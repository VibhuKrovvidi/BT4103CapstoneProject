Please refer to the following: https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...idelines-rt/rt Quote: In the event that D is more than 20, it will be capped at 20. You will not have to take RT but must attempt at least 1 IPPT (i.e. Non-ICT IPPT or ICT IPPT) in your IPPT Window. IPPT is also conducted on the 8th, 14th and 20th RT sessions (also known as RT IPPT). But if there are less than 8 RT sessions, RT IPPT will be held on the last session. Hence, the correct answer is :In window 16/17, I only have to attend 7 RT sessions, and the 7th session will be my RT-IPPT. I will not be a defaulter in the following window.","almondNeo wrote: Let me emphasis, you attempted 13 IPPT in window 15/16 and failed and you're required to attend 7 RT in window 16/17. In window 16/17, the criteria to complete RT, as mentioned by Calander also, is the completion of the sessions required PLUS 1 attempt of IPPT.  Given that you'll only require 7 sessions of RT, there won't be any 8th sessions for you hence you won't be able to book your IPPT. Hence, you'll be deemed as IPPT defaulter in window 16/17 and congrats, 20 sessions of RT is waiting in window 17/18."

You can also fulfil your RT requirements earlier by passing an In-Camp Training (ICT) IPPT or either of your first 2 RT IPPT sessions.   The 1st RT-IPPT will be on the 8th.

161,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",terrykorkor,"I think, maybe people might have heard of some flaw in the RT system in the past. For the 1st year, you will just fail your ippt at the last day of your current 1st year window, and you will be asked to do RT on the second year window while your second year IPPT window opens. However, after you completed your RT session in the 2nd year, your 2nd year IPPT window is automatically cleared too. Effectively, you will only need to do RT every 2 years. I think laojiao might know what I am talking about here in the early days. If you can pass your IPPT easily, then this is probably not a topic for you. There are even ways to calculate the minimum amount of times you need to go to FCC (which includes risking and the amount of time you can get disciplinary warning from NS + the penalty cost of it). But I will not discuss this here. However, NS.sg update their system 1-2 years ago and required soldiers to attend ippt asap or else face disciplinary action for that year (in term of window). You will need to clear ippt (as pass status, or through completion of ipt/rt) for every window. So, I believe, the patch up the loophole. Actually, I think going for RT/IPT is good. At least a few days of exercise is the healthy choice isn't it.","Calander wrote: is all 1 year.. never ever a 2 years cycle.  so to say, if in Year 2 u still cannot complete ""20-D"" RT sessions, in Year 3 u will need to do ""20-D"" again.

427,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",kaisoz,"First time will be warning. When they charge you first time, can be at CMPB, or at your unit camp, or during ICT if there is an upcoming ICT. So far, I have never heard of people kenna first charge and fined. But kenna fine is the worst case scenario for first time charge. Unless you really go and shoot back at them gaolat gaolat. If you do that, you will confirm hong gan gao gao. If you get called to CMPB, its also not confirmed that you definitely will get fined. I went CMPB before to answer charge, no fine. But basically, your fate is in the hands of the officer-in-charge. If you show guai lan face and talk back, then of course kena fine or worse is a possibility. Now, after clearing the first charge, its up to you liao. If you bochup again the next year or two, of course, be prepared to face charge again and kenna fined again. If you don't want to give $ to SAF, then you must plan your RT now. If you are totally CMI case, confirm cannot pass on the 8th or 14th RT session, that means you have to go for the full 20 RT sessions. Well, actually its 17 RT and 3 RT-IPPT (8th,14th,20th). Lets say you go for the full 20 sessions. If you go once every weekend, you clear your IPPT liabilities in 20 weeks. If you can squeeze out 1 weekday, then you clear in 10 weeks. If you are getting up there in age, and very long never do exercise, never even go kick football or play bball, then I sincerely advise you to do some light workouts at home, since right now, you may not be able to book RT sessions, until you finish the charge process. Just do like 5-10 pumping. Or wake up on weekend, do like 10 minute jogging before you jiak breakfast. This is to slowly work your body into some physical shape. Thus, you reduce the risk of injury. If you suddenly do RT exercise, can get injured de. Moi tio injury during RT. Heng, I had enough time to recover, before continuing RT and passing on the 14th RT-IPPT. Ownself should ownself know own body. So take care always, think safety always. Yes, starting the RT process is super duper sian and marhuan, and really throws a kink into your schedule. Everyone knows. The only hard part is clearing your work schedule enough to start. Once you start, its very easy liao. You basically can just show face at RT, go through the motions can liao. If you want to quickly pass and avoid going more RT sessions, then of course you will have to put in effort. After you clear RT, can consider the IPT process, since its much shorter, only 10 sessions niah. RT or IPT, you still get paid. So it helps cover public transport (plus makan) totally or partially helps cover fuel costs if taking motorbike or car. Haiz, what to do? Born in SG ish like that de. NS for sinkies, jobs for FTs. Good luck on your charge.","busybeeman wrote: Hello bros,  So I failed my IPPT last year and did not go for the 19 RT sessions. My closing window is next month.

887,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",Calander,"1 - MO will still have to endorse as a form of acknowledging your ""outside"" doctor's note. MO will make the decision as to how many months u shall be excused from IPPT. There is a policy that if the excused is more than a certain period of month, you will then be excused from clearing the IPPT window. However, for your case is quite vague but i believe it can be excused. 2 - ICT in june... if your MO gives the excuse of IPPT that your ICT is during this period, u are not allowed to take part in the IPPT. basically when u meet your camp's MO, do check with your S1 or S8 / NSC / Persnode about your IPPT window. Or you can request NS hotline to inform your unit to give u a callback. this should help in your queries.","Ggdotcomzzz wrote: Hi all  My window closes at the end of June 2019 and I am currently in my RT window.

1335,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",Calander,"u seem very interested to get downgraded instead.  in fact your situation is after seeing the specialist on 18 Feb, the doctor will issue a recommendation memo to either support for excuse upper/lower limbs or any other excuses, including certain exercises depending on your condition.  As you had mentioned, your MO will only accept letter from specialist which you will have that on 18 Feb itself. Given your IPPT is in June, I do not understand what kind of answers you are trying to get here.  So as to answer to your question directly, if your specialist supports you to be exempted from IPPT, you will most likely be exempted for your IPPT in June. But the funny thing is, you having ICT starting on 18 Feb also.  Therefore, you should be concerned with your ICT-IPPT in Feb, and not in June.  Perhaps you should clarify your situation better or you are trying to smoke something out.","Jyuan83 wrote: Hi i have appt to see specialist at NTFGH on 18/2 which is also the first day of my ict.

To be honest I’m worried about the covid evolving situation at that time. But I still have to do my best to clear as many sessions as possible.

Then Mindef waived my window. My new window has just started. And as days pass by, my window is getting shorter. So yes, it is our responsibility to clear the window WITHIN the one year period.

Alternatively, you can email us at contact@ns.sg or visit our website at www.ns.sg for more information.  We will be pleased to assist you.

Q: Why SAT/SUN no IPT-IPPT ? A: The reason is HQ realize that the session start at 9.30am so by then finish about 10am+ and weather is going to be warm for 2.4km test.

Today consider you attend 1 IPT session Q: So how are we going to clear the windows ? A: Our OC is going to HQ this tuesday to find out what is the solution for this impact that those unable to book all session so please check your NS portal on tuesday to find out more.

A: Current plan by HQ is 24th or 26th of JAN 2021 (NOT CONFIRM YET so do check it out), we will open more slots for weekdays and will be 2 sessions (NOT CONFIRM YET) as we know this is an issue now.  Q: So IPT-IPPT still stick the same (SAT/SUN) only right  A: Yes. Still the same so please book your section correctly.  Hope my information is helpful and accurate as possible so please do a look out for more slot. As earlier most ppls here mention, at least do 1 IPPT before windows to void default .."

The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) announced this on Monday (Mar 15) as it unveiled plans for NS FIT to be available at 45 locations islandwide. There are currently 13 sites where NSmen can undergo training.  Under the new programme, NSmen will be able to choose from at least six different NS FIT training activities to fulfil the required 10 sessions.  They can register for sessions through the ns.sg portal from March 25.  Currently, those unable to pass IPPT can opt for 10 voluntary IPPT preparatory training (IPT) sessions, or participate in up to 20 remedial training (RT) sessions.  Brigadier-General Kenneth Liow, director of National Service Affairs, said NS FIT would streamline this ""complicated"" system of annual fitness requirements into one common programme  Each NS FIT session, lasting approximately 60 to 75 minutes, can be easily fit into NSmen's busy schedules, he added.  ""The vast majority of our NSmen meet their fitness requirements,"" said BG Liow. ""NS FIT is aimed at trying to promote a more healthy and active lifestyle.""  The programme is one of the NS review committee's initiatives and also a collaboration between the SAF, Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Sport Singapore (SportSG).  The three organisations had in 2017 signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote fitness and health among NSmen.  On top of existing training locations at parks, Safra gyms and Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs) within army camps, NSmen can choose to undergo NS FIT at an additional three upcoming gym sites under ActiveSG - the national movement for sport - and 29 locations under HPB's Quick HIIT (high intensity interval training) banner.  The Quick HIIT programme, started in 2018 as a first initiative under the MOU, is conducted seven days a week at malls, community spaces and SportSG facilities.  It is open to the general public and features short bursts of high-intensity exercises that build strength, endurance and aerobic fitness over time.  This is similar to metabolic circuit sessions conducted at FCCs, which also offer activities focused on aerobic threshold, weight loss, sports and IPPT-specific exercises.  Sessions at the Safra gyms are customised based on individual needs, and should an NSman decide to attend NS FIT at one, he will have to compete all 10 sessions at either of the six dedicated FIT @ Safra gyms.  The programme at the upcoming ActiveSG gym sites - in Bedok, Jurong East and Tampines - will be confirmed later.  The 10 sessions include one IPPT attempt, to be taken at the NSman's choosing. If he passes the test before the 10 sessions, he will not need to fulfil the remainder.  NS FIT was trialled from 2018 to 2019 with about 250 NSmen, including a brigade commanded by Colonel (NS) Michael Hua, 49.  He said: ""The feedback we got from the guys from the ground was (that) it gives them flexibility, and offers convenience. More importantly, it allows them to integrate fitness into their lifestyles.""  NSmen's friends and family can also join them in their Quick HIIT sessions by booking a slot using HPB's Healthy 365 mobile app.  Home Team's NSmen will also adopt NS FIT from June onwards. They will be able to undergo FIT sessions at Home Team premises, HomeTeamNS Clubhouses and ActiveSG gyms.  https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-fit-programme",NIL

The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) announced this on Monday (Mar 15) as it unveiled plans for NS FIT to be available at 45 locations islandwide. There are currently 13 sites where NSmen can undergo training.  Under the new programme, NSmen will be able to choose from at least six different NS FIT training activities to fulfil the required 10 sessions.  They can register for sessions through the ns.sg portal from March 25.

2373,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",Nuclear Boy,"I guess they're assuming I'm referring to IPPT taken together with FIT. But explicit enough to say if never complete first time round (e.g. only do IPPT, never do 9x FIT), next cycle is Mandatory.","Quote: Kindly be advised that NSmen must book and attempt at least one IPPT session and they can exit from the NS Fit Programme once they pass their IPPT. And if NSmen fails their IPPT attempt, they may either book for another IPPT session once they are ready or complete the remaining NS Fit sessions. So long the NSmen completes 10 sessions within his IPPT window, he will be considered that his NS Fit Programme is complete.  If you are unable to complete all 10 NS FIT sessions within your IPPT window, you will not be considered a defaulter as you have clocked in an IPPT attempt. However, you will be required to complete a mandatory NS FIT programme for your next mandatory NS FIT window."
