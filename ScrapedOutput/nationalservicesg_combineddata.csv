I called and emailed CMPB but they just said they will schedule in a few months?? I am afraid my enlistment would be delayed and its quite worrying to be perpetually pes D. Would emailing my member of parliament to speed things up be helpful? Is there any other way to speed things up? Thanks!
Edit: The pending appointment has not been scheduled yet. When I called to ask, they said they will schedule mucb later but not sure when, so I want to speed this up."

"RSO During BMT On Sunday. Need advice! Some Background:
Before Booking out to collect my A level results, I was on 3 day light duty due to a knee injury sustained during training. However, my knee injury is still persistent and I would like to report sick outside (RSO). I have to Book in on Sunday, but polyclinics are closed now & I’m not sure if GP clinics are certified medical practictioners and has the Authority to give MC to stay at home for me to recover. My commanders have not been helpful and only stated Govnt hospitals/Polyclinics & a general guide for RSO. i’m aware that i would have to stay at home and update my commanders on my movements. Can anyone advice me on certified practictioners (GP) to consult for RSO as my case isnt life threatening to be sent to A&E hospital, but rather I’m unfit for duty. Just super confused and helpless at this point.."

"My experience in NS as an Indian. Hey guys. Just wanted to throw this out here 

During my basic training I found that I had no trouble getting along with my squad mates, apart from the occasional jokes about my Indian accent, which I took in a good natured manner. 

Fast forward to unit life, and I seem to be having a bit of trouble. Don’t get me wrong I’m not super depressed or angry or some shit, just wanted to see what you guys think. 

One of my instructors keeps telling me “this is india not singapore hold the gun properly not like some Bollywood star” or “do you know why I wouldn’t send you to stand in a spot in the shade?” And just constantly belittles my race. 

A couple of guys in my squad also constantly mock my accent, not in the fun way my basic training friends used to. When I told them I was gonna do a comp engg degree after NS, their first comment was “why follow the stereotype”. That stung quite a bit. I’ve worked my ass off to get in to that course and they just think it’s some BS that every Indian does or wtv. They even make jokes like “oh does your dad work at a money changer / when you grow up you can start a scam call centre business”. 

Am I just overreacting? Like should I just stay calm and play along with these jokes as I’ve been doing so far? I feel like Singapore’s USP is that it’s a place with racial harmony etc. But from my experience so far it’s just that all the racism is swept under the carpet. Any advice? Thanks everyone!"

"Hi I'm a little bit confused. How different is Physical Training Phase (PTP) and Obese BMT? Okay so my BMI is 28.2 so I'm most likely gonna be PES BP (I haven't gotten it officially yet). Thing is, I got 65 points (meaning pass with incentive) for IPPT hence the IPPT calculator on CMPB website says ""If you are graded PES A or B1, you will be exempted from the 8-week Physical Training Phase."" 

IIRC, if one is PES BP he'll have to go for Obese BMT. After completing that they'll review his BMI and reclassify him into another PES grade. 

My question is that is Obese BMT the same as PTP? Or are they different? 

Are they held at two different times (Obese BMT at the start of NS and PTP at the end)? So if it as such, if I become PES A or B1 at the end of Obese BMT then I won't have to do PTP later on? 

I took my IPPT in school, in case this information is needed.

Thanks!"

"Stuck in SCS coy for 3+ Months after OOC. Any advice? Hey there! I was from the 46/20 (grats on graduating guys!) batch of SCS cadets. I was posted here after completing BMT (from mono 42 SAR) and OOC’d due to an injury. Long story short, I have been stuck with my SCS coy since November and have yet to be posted out. I have tried talking to my Ops Spec, CWO, 2IC, OC and even S1 of my unit and all have given me the 🤷‍♂️ and told me there is nothing they can do but to wait. I was told my long term status is affecting my posting, but I need the status to protect myself. While I am not suffering here, the lack of purpose and overall draining of my energy has been depressing and I even developed symptoms of depression that I am currently seeking help for. For those wondering, I am currently on status till end March.

TL;DR: OOC SCS found term due to injury (on long term status), want to get posted out, tried talking to all possible channels to no avail, getting depressed about it, any advice?"
"Need advice on whether i should try to downpes with existing injury? Commando. Currently I am in CDO, and I am getting sick and tired of this combat unit. I suffered a lower back injury earlier in my airborne phase and was referred for MRI but i didnt go. I pushed on for awhile, but currently I feel that the environment is toxic, and we are doing things with no actual purpose, other than to feed the egos of our commanders and those who actually enjoy it. I’m losing my motivation, but a part of me still want to complete this journey. 

What I am worried about is my reservist. I do no see myself doing this again when I am in my 30s. So say I get to downpes, how will my reservist life be affected?

Edit: what i forgot to mention is that the next scheduled MRI is 1.5 months away, that makes it a little more difficult for me to decide"

"Knee pain for 3 weeks showing no signs of recovering... My knee had been slightly injured before my field camp. Since we had to high kneel literally anywhere and everywhere it worsened the injury. Worst still we had our 8km road march after we came back from field camp and despite resting over the weekend and this Lunar New Year break my knee is still having issues. Basically, whenever I wake up or sit for a long time my knees would hurt a significant bit and become stiff, however when I run the pain and stiffness goes away. Am I actually injured or is it something else not putting my knee health in jeopardy? All opinions are welcomed and I hope to get some good advice before my 12 km road march!  


P.S. I didn't report sick because I wanted to complete my high keys and not have to retake it with people from other coys."

"I dont think PES has anything to do with camera phones haha, it rly depends on your job function, security zoning (green/red) and unit requirement/ enforcement."
"Regardless of PES, camera phones are allowed in any Green Zones, which should be most camps. Camera phones are only prohibited in Red Zones. It’ll usually be states which areas are red zones."
"This is a friendly reminder not to share any **confidential information** about a particular camp or base in posts/comments.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NationalServiceSG) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
"as others have said, pes has absolutely nothing to do with whether camera phones. If a zone is red zone, you are not allowed to have camera phones. but if it is green zone then yes allowed. regardless of pes status"
"Usage of camera phones are allowed if you are in Green Zone camps, not by your PES classification.

If you are entering Red Zone camp or ops room, you need to surrender and deposit in the lockers provided before you enter. If you are posted to a red zone camp, you might need to sandblast/remove your phone's camera if you do not have a spare non-camera phone.

Green Zone allows camera phones to be brought in but you are still not allowed to use the camera function (Any form of military/non military photos/videos taken inside the camp premises are also included)."
Depends on your sir/mdm
infantry
B2 is everything except the most xiong - commando and guards.
B2 no command school that’s for sure
"I thought pes b2 cant go combat vication. At most combat support like combat engineer, artillery etc"
8sir trooper maybe
Who say b2 cannot go?
"Im pes b2, my playoon sgt said normally cant go. If you do get it quite rare. Only 1 guy in my whole bmt coy got infantry trooper"
maybe same bed
"I don't know about chances but you can't ask to be in the same platoon or not. It's same as a school, you can't ask the teachers to place you and ur friends in the same class just because you want to"

Nope! Both are different organisations
ask CPT Levi
"No, because you'll need to do SAF BMT.

I don't think SPF and scdf trainees can post out after basic training. I only know SAF trainees can go to home team after BMT."
Bro serious you from real police want to join “fake” police
"Damn that's unfortunate, thanks for the reply!"
The only fake police is NPCC lmao
"Both are ""real"" police, except they govern different areas. Don't make stupid comments you have no knowledge of"
"Sign on if you want MP. SPF pay is better though, with more off days"
bro spf is better. also u become an infanteer for ict once u ord as mp
I think in the end PES F is a big decision and likely will require medical board with you in present and an SAF specialist. Don’t think it ultimately matters whether public or private specialist memo.
"for me i was assigned from saf to govt hospital doc (took 1-2 months - pes E1 at the time) took another 2 months for the govt doctor to ask my MO to send me for med review at med board and took another 2-3 months before I see the MMI doctor for the review (though I saw 2 in the room - not sure if they were both docs or one was clear and the other doc) and another 1-2 months to be officially PES F'd by the medical board.

government bureaucracy at its finest, you need the doctors to be on the ball and hope there isnt a big queue. but generally govt is fine i never spent a penny on private since i was a poor recruit"
"If you are asking a medical question, please ask your MO. They will be able to give you an accurate answer.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NationalServiceSG) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
"They both hold the same power. Govt route just takes longer and they’re very quick to classify your ailments as non chronic because they don’t spare provide all the resources to make a proper diagnosis. I once requested for an mri to a specialist in sgh. He literally just shouted at me “you will never get an mri! You only get one if you’re dying!” That’s when I knew private was the only option. Wasted 7 years on Govt route and suffered in every ict. Private took 3 mths and with medical board, I got downgraded in 6 mths."
Cause I have heard people saying private specialist are less reliable because they can be bought with money to write fake reports
Can I pm u?
"Yep, that’s the more overriding feeling. If public hospital with no money-benefits for writing memo, they might trust a bit more."
Sure
I see thank you
to see which dum dums get sent to die first
Factors into your vocation posting.
give u false hope
Unless you got memo from specialist to prove that you are fine to up pes but most likely only until C. A/B1 is quite unlikely.
Very Low especially for E
"No, am a mp here and lowest we take in is pes b4"
No
Yes
"just curious, what roles are there for b4?"
"really depends on your medical issue. I know of someone that has ""weak lungs"" and asthmatic in b4 and he can pretty much go to most of the roles available. If u rly curious can pm"
"Nope, it's going to be the easiest few tests you will ever do in your life.  You can bring in notes, use phone to do the test, instructors will literally tell you what will be tested. If you fail, they will go through the test with you so you will know the answers. On the slight chance that you fail, it doesn't matter anyway unless you're aiming for admin specs. And even if you fail it's still possible to be admin specs cos I have friends that failed but are admin specs. Just enjoy your time during the asa training phase hahahah"
Test will be conducted after each lecture or at the end of bmt?how much is the passing marks?
"You need to attend all your appointments and follow ups. Once it is done, CMPB will process the medical reports and the findings before they can give you your finalised PES grade.

PES D is pending further review. I was on PES D for 1 month as they needed to test my blood for hepatitis due to family history.

Emailing your MP won’t do much of a help actually. Another way to “speed up” is to give them a call every few days after you finished your final medical appointment."
"They won’t forget u, after pes D for a while, they will issue temporary pes E9 even without a final review. That’s what happened to me. Don’t worry"
I emailed CMPB once a week detailing how my PES was still D although my other friends already got a confirmed PES status. My appointment was 10 months after the medical checkup at CMPB. I started emailing them regularly one month before my appointment and it was very quickly scheduled after I emailed them many times.
"Best thing to do is to visit CMPB with a parent and ask them if you can meet the medical officer there, it will definitely speed things up"
"When was your first medical appointment? How long was it already? My son was pes D for 8 months. He consulted his teacher who told him to write in. Then also i told him to email them n state in the email that he spoke to his teacher who told him to email them, then cc to his sch teacher n us (his parents). He got called up within a week, went for one more appointment (he went for 2 previously) n pes confirmation took another 3 months. Got his enlistment letter 3wks before enlistment date."
"Yea, but you see the problem is, I have 1 unscheduled medical appt before I get my PES. For some reason they say they wont schedule this appointment for quite a while. So I want to ask my MP to speed up the scheduling, would this work? Thanks!"
"Wait, so how long did you take to get E9 and was your enlistment delayed? Also you went into NS with pes E?"
"oh wow ok, I guess spam emailing works. Guess Ill try that, thanks!"
My appointment is with a specialist doctor under CMPB though and not a regular medical officer. But thanks for the suggestion!
"First medical appt was in November, should I email them again? Also, I thought pes status normally takes 3 weeks, your son took 3 months to get his PES? Thanks!"
"Have you tried making the appointment by yourself at a public hospital’s outpatient clinic? Or is it a must for CMPB to make the appointment for you?

Are you graduating soon?"
"Instead of Jan-Feb, I enlisted April/may, if I am not wrong they will call u and let u know when u want to enlist, they will give u a few dates I think. Yes ,I went into Ns with temporary e9 at kranji"
"He took 11months from first medical appointment，3 assessment before getting his pes status 3 weeks prior to enlistment in Jan. He didn't manage to clear his ippt by x date so he went in later batch.

If u can't wait, consult your teacher who will probably ask u to email them. Then email them said teacher said email them n cc to teacher. Otherwise depending on your intake window, maybe try calling again. 

Meanwhile clear your ippt first."
"I think the appointment needs to be made by CMPB. Also, I will graduate in a couple of months, but the problem is the appointment will also be made in more than a couple of months according to the call so there might be a delay. Last time they told me the appointment will be made in about 3 months, its already been 5 months since then and when I called today they said they still need a few more months?"
"Oh ok, so I will not get delayed and the appointment can be pushed to after I enlist?"
"Ok thanks, I think I will email them a few more times then get teachers involved."
"You give them a call again and ask if you could make the appointment by yourself and said that you have yet to receive any appointment for your medical condition from them for 5 months.

Normally they would not delay appointments (especially when the pre-enlistee is graduating in less than 6 months) unless the appointment schedule is full all the way until the first available date.

Typically you should receive your enlistment letter about 2-4 months before your actual enlistment date."
"Yes. You don’t need a final memo to get enlisted. U will be enlisted with a temporary pes. Ur uni or whatever won’t be disrupted regardless. This is based on my own experience, not sure for others"
"I think the appointment needs to be done by a SAF doctor, but ok thanks a lot!"
Ok tks so much!

"S1 branch refers to that of a Bn/bde, I think you mean pers node?"
Probably you will get back the same PES bah if your condition is still the same as what you declared 2 years ago.
"If you didnt declare any issues, you'll be pes b1"
thanks bro
Can just play water. No worries man. They won’t force you to swim and it’s also impossible for you to learn how to swim in such a short period of time.
not an issue because swimming is not a requirement for u to POP. you will simply be assigned to the group of non swimmers and learn the basics there
I don't think so? I used to be PES E1 and was also concurrently permanent excused swimming and all in-water activities.
the difference btw e1 and e9 is covered shoes or sun exposure according to my source
[deleted]
"Actually I was PES B1 but OOC-ed and down PES to E1 before going back up in Mar 2020, so I didn't do the PES E BMT haha"
"Don't mind me asking, what kind of certain events requires you to have your IC instead of your 11B?

Because from my knowledge, 11B acts as your IC for your 2 years of service."
"I needed my IC as I was converting from PR to citizen in the middle of NS. What I did was to email MHA (SPF), told them my situation and my proof from ICA, and they then promptly liaised with ICA themselves and temporarily gave me back my IC (PR). After citizenship registration they cut my old IC and issued the new one DIRECTLY to MHA who then held it for me until ORD."
"Your 11B should be sufficient as it contains more personal info than the typical IC.

11B is as good as or even better than an IC.

If they insist that you need to show IC, show them a picture of the front and back of your NRIC taken before you enlist for NS. Not so sure if your eNRIC in your singpass app will change to 11B or not."
Didn’t think that’s even possible.
"I had to draw my IC to trade for a new IC for change of particulars. You can try calling the IC department/cmpb to enquire about drawing ur IC, though I think you need to have a valid reason or relevant document to do it."
"not long enough to complain? encountered such a guy before, he didnt complain abt his collection time so id assume its <=15mins?"
"Hi, it will be approx 10-15 minutes, I suggest you call them in advance before you actually head into CMPB (10-20 minutes ahead) for them to find your IC first, then it will just be a quick exchange of your 11B with the IC after you sign some form.

&#x200B;

Do note that you will need to exchange the IC back for your 11B after the event.

&#x200B;

Source: Converted to SC last year and had to switch out my IC"
"Not sure. But as I understand it, if it is required for official/government related issues, you could email CMPB directly. They are usually open to communication and they can direct you to relevant processes for such things. Just be prepared to justify your case with documents and emails."
You won’t see your IC for 2 years. Impossible.
"One example that I know of is when registering as a new Singapore Citizen, you will have to present your original Blue IC as ICA will have to punch a hole on it to invalidate the IC as you will be getting a replacement IC collection slip that acts as your temporary IC until you are issued the Pink IC during the Singapore Citizenship Ceremony."
"there still are cases IC is needed instead of 11B. PR to SC is one of them, ive met a guy who signed on to SPF after enlisting in army so he had to take back his IC from CMPB. im pretty sure there are other cases where the physical authentic IC is required instead of 11B"
"Not true as it is not applicable to all gov jobs....so, you better take care of your mental wellness issue first instead of worrying. Your health is most important & jobs & all can be sorted out later. Dont listen to that fearmongering superior of yours."

For engineers, first 5 weeks will be spent at Nee soon camp, undergoing counter ied training. Will get cied badge after this 5 weeks. You will learn how to prepare and ignite live charges during this time. No outfields in the field pack sense but there is outfield training. 


Average day during my time last year would be RO at 5pm. High keys include demo Live Firing and a summex. 

After this five weeks, you will be split into further specializations, Armour, field, plant, bridging, cbrd, eod. My batch was the bridging, cbre batch. Next batch will be field, plant, and Armour."
"Do we also have like wake up 0500 then like morning PT? How’s an average day in the life?

"E1 is your army PES, ranging from A, B1-B4, C2, C9, E1 and E9, and F. 
E1 is quite low, means you are pretty much doing service or service support. 

N9 refers to your N-code, which goes from N1 to N9. N-code only relevant to navy personnel, as it determines whether you are eligible for ship duties. N9 basically means you cannot go for any kind of ship duties."
"That’s a few areas they will look into. Such as your education level, result(BMT RESULT which are all the activities that score is given.) and the test you did in CMPB."
"Education level then IPPT, then SIT test and peer appraisal. I know of a guy that is best fitness, best in platoon ippt gold, in bmt, went SCS when he is OCS worthy type with real leadership. He got Gold bayo in SCS. But went interview but still cannot go OCS coz low gpa. 

While a ippt gold best in platoon with 3.8gpa went OCS after bmt"
then do you have any idea how they will see jc students
"Same thing applies ah. Result also. Then IPPT, then SIT test then peer appraisal. 

Leadership qualities is impt also, but its just in the form of taking initiative but not to the point where you section mates find you annoying. Fieldcamp leadership is kinda more important than normal days. That's when Commanders really keep a lookout for potential people(IMO). 

Either way these are what i observed from the times I served on who went cmd school. Just be yourself, I personally rejected going to command school because i hated the ""leadership"" system in SAF. And i was proven right when i go unit seeing Men that can lead better than Commanders be it SGT or Officer."
Dont forget IC ya?
Don’t bring so much because that’s what you will bring back during your first book out. Just bring the necessary stuff can liao.
"Your packing should be quite light as compared to those enlisting in mono intake or to Tekong.

The most important things you need to pack are: your NRIC, sufficient undergarments, hand washable detergent and toiletries to last for at least two weeks, at least 5 to 6 clothes hangers, clothes pegs, personal hygiene products (deodorant, shaver, shaving cream etc), sufficient powerbanks.

Do not bring snacks in as you won't be allowed to consume it during your BMT and also to reduce the probability of pests invading your bunk.

Check out this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8a8isp/important\_items\_to\_bring\_for\_bmt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8a8isp/important_items_to_bring_for_bmt/)"
"Washing powder, black tape, pens and markers, ruler, underwear, extra padlock."
You are a legend. Found this helpful!
Honestly I think you just go take private cos if uk ur shit u can pass q fast. Tho with covid u might have issues booking the stuff that requires u to go thru the driving schs and stuff
"Go find a good private instructor and tell them you were military driver.

If you lucky then they won't drag lessons and clear you fast. Because less lessons = less money they earn."
Go private will be the fastest and cheapest. But due to covid might take up to 6 months for you to clear everything.
"Only after field camp. It's gonna get dirty anyways, so only wash just so not get caught having muddy bag."
"i wash it after outfield, or if it happens to get wet because of rain, leaked bottle etc, or it gets really nasty"
"After you POP, just bring ur assault pack, LBS, field pack to the laundromat and wash it there. Fuss free"
"yes, if i have more than 48 hours out to ensure ample time to dry.  probably once every 2/3 weeks.   


i throw it into my washing machine and detergent the fuck outta it bc it kinda smells bad at the back area where you carry it ?"
Would be really helpful in artillery tho.

"You'd probably won't be in a combat vocation depending on how sever your hearing problem is- sometimes you'd need to whisper instructions/listen to hushed instructions. You also need to be able to listen which direction sound came from


 
But don't worry, might be posted in pes c/e or something similar."
"""Ya obviously""  which most karen will reply. Username checks out"
"No real tips tbh. Just tahan only. Make sure your section stores are distributed evenly and your field pack is packed well. Just keep digging. It will be shag because it is the first full-blown company mission attack + defence exercise and after covering your shellscrapes, mg and fire trench, still got the charlie mike."
"During stand to, try to nap as much as possible w/o getting caught. Attach your flashlight to your helmet when digging at night, instead of using your mouth. Finally, have fun. Dumpin was v fun cos we got to sabo other platoon's defence and even got a bottle of coke for a job well done. Have fun. Enjoy your service term while it lasts."
Have you tried talking to your commanders? Maybe can try to request a change of camp.
My guess is that it's soo absolutely choked up in safety protocols and encryption it just slows to a crawl every time anyone uses it.
Yes.
Don’t even get me started on the Learnet tablet
"The infrastructure that learnnet was built on is probably budget-tight servers that has several layers of unnecessary security due to its high confidentiality.

That aside, it’s also due to the way the site was built, the amount of custom integrations that causes the “lag” on the website. Even when running on a 1gbps LAN connection, the loading of certain quizzes still take ~4mins to open at times. 

Imho, it’s just bad planning of website infrastructure along with budget."
Free admin time
For 2 years of my service they never got back to me on my changed password so I never got into my Learnet account LOL
"HTTPS itself is considered military grade, so I don't suspect safety protocols and encryption. I'm guessing it's because Learnet is hosted on a small server and 600+ people are accessing it at the same time."
The tablet wasn't the best thing but using it to browse internet during BMT is better than nothing. I used it a lot to play browser games and watch youtube back then.
Thats right
^ this is most likely the answer.
"I once tried accessing Learnet an hour before reveille, and the speed is actually decent."
A good life: Lots of admin time; Wifi in bunks; Patient commanders.
Good life good food. Enjoy
What time do stayout people report and leave?
Stayouts reported at about 0600-0630 after breakfast and before FP and leaving time can vary a lot depending on if you get all your stuff done for the day but I would expect before 2100 always can be 1900-2000 if lucky
What if I live far away?
That one is tough but there's no exceptions  you have to make up time yourself
"Yes please fucking bring some, especially the high quality ones that gym goers will recognise. A madlad in my company brought a whole tupperware box of them. It got confiscated at first but after a few days they returned it to us and a bunch of sergents and occifers bought them off of him. They paid in cash and Paynow and the lad made a couple dollars profit and several healthy favours"
why need protein bars when u got free protein meatsticks?
"Try not to bring any form of food during your enlistment day. If you do, they will safekeep your food until your first book out. Your commanders will inform you on what kind of food is allowed to bring in before your first book out after you completed the 2-week confinement period."

"Okay, I get the reasoning for this, but don't you think that 1 week and 10 karma is a lot for a starter account?

And rather than removing, why not just flag as potential spam and see what to approve? I totally understand the reasoning, but at the same time it's unfortunate"
"The reasoning for this restriction is to ensure the credibility of accounts posting on this subreddit, we understand it is harsh, but it is beneficial to many of us.

For the readers, we assure you that with fewer malicious posts, you are better given posts about stories, advices and praises.

For the mods, by having more credible posters, we can tune down on moderating too much, giving posters and readers more space and freedom.

Not sure about this flagging as potential spam, but it sounds like mods would have to work more to choose which post to approve or not, this restricts the community even further since you will need a mod just to post whatever you want"

tried checking in ur bank acc statements directly?
Could be due the public holidays that the system is slow updating the payslip.
You in desperate need for the money or something?
"I got my salary already but they didn’t upload the payslip either. Don’t worry, you probably have your money."
🤦‍♂️ bro i say that because of this month CNY as i know that chinese personal will get the money early but for those non-chinese will still get at the same date like before but my one is super weird as for the past 3 month my payslip show on 10 of the month but this month my payslip is not out yet till now as you can see in the photo.
Lol no as i mean scare later they never pay me for this month

"Isn't K9 unit are regular sign-on only? I think mistakes of your dog = yours. In worst case, it's replace you, and not the dog."
"Hi fellow NSF! I’ve expressed interest in dog handling to my cm since I grew up with lots of dogs but sadly they only take 1-2 people per intake :( cuz of covid and it’s not really in demand.

There will definitely be a fair amount of people in your intake choosing K9 as their first option so you should really try to convince your cm to fight a spot for you. 

Training wise I heard that it’s easy? But that really depends on how attentive you are in my opinion and about failing I am not so sure about that."
Thanks for the insight! No one else in my squad placed K9 as any of their options so hopefully I'll have a higher chance! Unfortunately my cm doesn't really like me as I fell sick during my PDT week :(
"Hmmm I am guessing your also from 182, I know a few people from that intake wanting to go K9 but if your cm hates you just try to prove him wrong by doing well in your law, shooting, ippt and etc."
"Yeah def its a possible action. Usually when you write to MP, unless your unit damn near wants to kill you, all the MP will do is write back to your unit heads who’ll then pump down to your direct commanders. MPs just somewhat function as wake-up calls to your unit that they’re being watched and that something is wrong than anything else 

However note that writing to MP is a last resort action. Don’t skip chain of command (aka sec com - PS/PWO - PC - OC - CO) before going to MP otherwise even if your problems are heard, you’re at the risk of being marked or informally punished for not sticking to chain of command. Its a serious serious folly to not follow CoC"
Can I pm you?
I have replied to your PM. :)
"Memo is free.

 You'd get the memo immediately.

 


 
Medical report is accessible by any doctors. So no need worry as they could just check your history"
"not sure where you got the information that ""Medical report is accessible by any doctors"", this is highly untrue - most information is not universally accessible between each of the healthcare institutions."
every vocation is possible
"Am from PES BP batch, 04/19. Vocations wise, it varies. You can get posted to Driver, Storeman, Mechanic, Medic, Signals, MP, Combat E, SCS/OCS, Security Trooper. If suay, get posted into Infantry. I have friends who're from PES BP who got posted to mono-infantry units. I also have friends who crossover to SCDF to become officers there.

Myself, I got posted to OES where I was trained to become a mechanic."
"BP batch here. Pes B1 is more or less the exact same as pes A vocation-wise. The pes B1 in my coy went to all sorts, from scs to infantry to transport. However I would B1 to be mostly combat related. 

B2 and below start getting relegated to non-combat or combat support vocations. I am in signals, (B4) combat support, and many of my batch went to do storeman, driver, maintenance, etc. One guy even lucked out and become clerk."
many pes BP recruits from my coy went to Armour
"You can go anywhere, unless you have a medical condition. Combat definitely a little lesser chance as compared to the enhanced intake where they’re considered ‘combat intake’.

I have a number of friends in combat units now and they’re all from pes bp"
Is there a lower chance to get a combat vocation if lets say i didnt pass my ippt or soc
Dragon...??
If im not wrong they will just throw u into any voc that requires manpower. If u never pass IPPT or SOC the combat voc can always train you up to pass them
IPPT may become an issue if you are trying for command school. SOC should not affect your vocation
"Typically it will take CMPB around 1-2 months for them to process your latest medical review before they send you your finalised PES. Since you are required to go to the Heart Centre for a review, it might take slightly longer or you may receive your finalised PES grade 1-2 months after your review.

For my case, they tested my blood for Hepatitis B as I might be a carrier due to family's medical history."
Usually 1 to 2 mths de. Just check the e health from time to time
"assuming your medical review at heart centre is already complete, take into account that:

1. your reports still have to be sent from heart centre to CMPB
2. all the reports have to be vetted by a doctor within CMPB and translated into a PES grade
3. your PES grade then needs time to be approved by higher authority

each of these steps need time, considering you are but one of many many people who are sent for further follow up appointments, and hospitals' medical records offices also have to deal with requests such as lawyers' reports, insurance reports etc (not just military)"
Alright thanks!! Wish u well :)
Okay great!! All the best for u :)
Thanks for the helpful info!!
if any doubt. you call CMBP hotline ba. hope you settle your PES then go enlistment soon
Only way to know is to ask during the interview I guess? Only their HR staff can give u a definitive answer as we dont know their manpower/operational requirements.
why apply now tho?
Really depends. Some company prefer ppl to start work asap. If u really good. They will keep in view
"Varies. Depends on the HR, but the typical response they would give you if they are very very interested in you is that you contact them again when your ord date is much nearer (~1mth) and go for another interview. 

Chances are if u mention u can only start work aft ord in 7mths thy’ll just put you at the back of the candidates"
The company will wait if they wanna wait. Ask the company
"Depends. In Healthcare, they definitely are willing to wait for you."
"If they want u, they will wait. Mostly no, they wont wait"
"Update : Company is willing to wait for me and I am gg to sign the job offer in 1-2 mths time.

Thank you all for the response :)"
"Honest direct answer is ""NO"" unless you have the unique experience, skill set, knowledge that are super rare in the market."

You can visit any western clinic aka GP to RSO as they are all certified doctors. But for Sundays they are usually closed so just head to any hospital and walk in to their A&E section. They are not only for emergency cases
"You will have to ask your commanders permission whether you can do it or not, if they don't allow, you to RSO, they might bring you to see the MO."
Ask if can go hospital ED (emergency department) to rso
"Check with your immediate superiors (sect comm) first on whether you can RSO, especially to private clinic’s GP.

If they don’t allow private GP, then you need to go to a public hospital’s A&E. 

As far as I know, they don’t accept MCs from TCM or sinsehs. Western GP MCs and public hospital’s MCs are accepted as long as your company/unit allows you to RSO."
"Just go and rso , polyclinics or AnE are FoC for servicemen don’t worry about what ur commanders say , unless u wna go OCS no point. U should tell the AnE doctor that u really can’t walk and u can benefit from a referral letter to see a specialist too dm 4 more info"
"If they insist on Restructured Hospital / Polyclinic, then walk to a&e since its FOC for serviceman"
Noted thank you!
"Yups, I will have no choice but to see MO."
"Yups, will check with commanders. Thank you!"
"Wow! I thought only Polyclinics are FOC, thanks for the info."
See specialist in restructured hospital / a&e and polyclinic is free lol
Hurray 🙌🏼
I believe you still have to wear smart casual with covered shoes

"Usually, to drop out on your own preference, you will have to have sounded off way earlier in the beginning of the course. Usually your PC/OC or even CO will say “those who want to OOC raise your hand and come talk to me later”. However, it will be really hard to OOC on your own accord afterwards and would usually need to be accompanied by a medical reason, be it metal or physical."
Just fail every written/mcq test and you'll eventually OOC.

"slim chance become infantry trooper, but most of the time you’ll go on to become an admin spec or lile other commenter said hq ncc"
"Probably to HQ NCC, most of them OOC from SCS."
For now 30 days at least..
Still will become spec without finishing pro term? How does that work?
So you nsf cpl need to say good morning to ncc sgt? Hahaha
They might offer you the option to recourse with the next batch of pro term cadets.
"yup, post to unit, do 3 months ojt then promote to spec"
"nope, there’s no need of nsf to greet the NCC cadets infact the NCC cadets should be the one that greets the nsf.

Good luck bro
"Well, I'm not gonna tell you to take it lightly because it hurts your feelings so obviously it matters to you. Some people in Singapore tend to not give a fuck about how racially insensitive they are, especially in the SAF when they are away from the civilian world. I would suggest you either stand up for yourself or keep a distance from these people that are saying such remarks as much as possible."
"Fuck man, I’ve gotten a lot of the same stuff stuff too, especially during my BMT (less so during SCS). It just gets tiring after a while. And yeah, Singapore does like to advertise it’s racial harmony a lot but like you said, often it’s just because it’s all swept under the rug. Seems to be getting better though.

If it’s really an issue, don’t feel afraid to mention it or bring it up with your commanders. If you feel like your sect comd isn’t going to help you, you can approach your PC too. But don’t stay quiet or just take it like it’s no problem yeah?"
Racism can’t be tolerated in the army please let your superiors know this serious problem
"Regular here, you can definitely go straight to your PC or OC regarding the behaviour of your instructor. Do not skip the chain of command. If your instructor is doing it, just go to the next person above him. Racism is not tolerated at all."
"Straight up tell them it's not funny or nice and to stop it. If they still continue then report it to your superiors.


Can't allow this shit. I'm Indian too and my experience wasn't as bad as yours. But I had to educate my platoon mates on what's no acceptable, because some people interacted very little with people of other groups like rave/education/SES etc."
"Wah fked up leh. Definitely damn racist. My unit had a mixture of races from Indian, Chinese, Malay, Eurasian and all from different countries but we all get along well. But your unit really damn racist. Please feedback to your superiors. Hopefully your life will be better"
"No you're not overreacting. Those are very racist remarks. I mean I get that some race-based jokes can be light-hearted and funny but your bunkmates and instructors are not even trying to spread laughter. 

>I feel like Singapore’s USP is that it’s a place with racial harmony etc. But from my experience so far it’s just that all the racism is swept under the carpet

Singapore is really good at marketing itself as however it wants others to perceive it. How do you think we got our hawker centres onto UNESCO's list of intangible heritage, despite hawkers also existing in Thailand and Malaysia?"
"Would you consider these specific people your friends? Maybe the bmt guys were but now it's more like annoying coworkers? Either way, it clearly bothers you, I think it wouldn't hurt to try remind them of the line they are kinda crossing now. ""You serious? That's really racist."" Yeah but as others have said, just report to your superiors if you rather not the direct confrontation.

&#x200B;

> not in the fun way my basic training friends used to. 

This is something I really appreciate. When friends acknowledge friends' heritage and joke about it in a non-malicious way. Personally I hope this sort of lightheartedness doesn't become unmentionables akin to cancel-culture in liberal US media, all because of toxic people like those in your squad. But hey that's a topic for another time."
"Regarding the comp engg stereotype, I see it as a good degree and thus a mild insult (or barely one) in my books. 

Maybe you can ask them if they would prefer to enter the workforce as a sociology major (extreme example)."
"In NS.  solders don't get singled out because of their race, but rather their behavior.  Really, not because you're Chinese or Malay, it's because, some Chinese may end up asking why there's no pork in a halal ration?  and situation like why a single Malay solder got his ration later then the others and start kicking up a fuss without first trying to understand there may be logistical hiccup and really not because he's Malay, and maybe that Chinese guy is really clueless about religious differences.  and if these solder continue to be ignorant.  obviously they will get singled out.  Hope you get the idea.

Like the saying..  When in Rome, do what the roman do.  Observe and pick up the good..  and just brush off the bad ones..  and don't try to go against or change a culture, but rather, blend in, and slowly your squad mates will think the same.  Pick up the good off you, and brunch off the bad you try to give them.."
"Yup. I do occasionally stand up for myself but I’m already the “odd one out” in the group and try not to make myself stand out anymore than I do already. Anyway, thanks for the advice!"
Yup. I’ll definitely keep this in mind. I think I can take it so far and if it goes too far when I feel like they’re not joking and legit being nasty then I do speak my mind. Thanks!
"Will do, thanks!"
Got it. Thank you so much :)
"I’ll do that more often. I shouldn’t let it slide, then maybe it may get better over time for the ones who suffer it after me as well. Thanks!"
Will do. Thanks for the input!
"That’s so true. They are #1 in marketing. While I love the place for giving me things like a beautiful country to live in, college subsidies etc. , things like this should be brought up more. Thanks for the advice :)"
"Yep. My BMT guys I would consider as friends, and the current ones as annoying coworkers, exactly as you’ve said. They’re nice at times and I get along but suddenly some weird switch flips in their brain and they get a bit wacko. Hopefully it improves and if it doesn’t I will report it for sure. Thanks!"
"Haha yeah honestly idk why I let the degree thing affect me because I know for myself it’s a competitive course and I worked my ass off to get in. Anyway, thank you!"
"I’m sorry to say but I’ve actually spent the past five months doing “as the romans do”. Some of them are very nice and don’t care whether I behave like Singaporeans or not. I’m not sure whether you’re applying that my behaviour causes me to be singled out? I take up my share of responsibilities and in fact had to pick up two IC roles and carry them out well before my basic training squad started respecting me and hence became friendlier. I’ve done my best to go along with the culture here, and by “blending in” if you mean just laughing along when they crack racist jokes about Indians then I’m not gonna stand for that. Even if they want to single me out, they can do it without pulling my race into things. I think you’ve misunderstood the situation I described in the post above. 👍🏽"
"mhm. Well realistically in these kinds of cases you just gotta distance yourself from them, not much you can do otherwise unfortunately."
""
"I think you misunderstood my reply..  No not suggesting it's your behavior to be the cause of what you're going through.  Anyway.  Locals also will mock locals, and even in movies like Deadpool and transformer where there are Indian culture and character added for the laugh?  

Maybe you're not use to the humor, and sometime, not trying too hard helps.  Just do your task, and serve your duty, and if you do find any jokes that is offensive, then like what many have suggested here, there's a long chain of command in the SAF you can go to, from PC all the way up to writing in to the Minister of Defence.."
Yup.
" Hi, I just got enlisted into bmt sch v PES E9. Just wondering if it is possible for me to enter the sergeant course and what I need to do to qualify? During the briefing, OCs make it seem like it is possible for us to enroll in the course and just want to clarify."
Hi does anyone have a spare recruit RAC that I can buy?
About to POP in 2 weeks. Heard that life is generally easier after BMT. Is there any truth to this? I get that it depends on where you're posted but what about the majority of the units? (Combat fit and indicated not going command school)

Now sure how it is for troopers in other formations. But if your BMT was easy like welfare coy then you go to infantry then good luck ah, it's a culture shock."

7) See MO, you'll have to drop your pants for this one 

If remember correctly you'll also get your picture taken and your measurements taken for your uniform etc. That's what I remember, not sure if I missed anything out."
just officially down pes today so around how long more i need to wait
And also a simple dental check by the dentist.
i heard that u have to stand butt naked and they will ask u to cough. Is it true?
I got mine 2 weeks after I downpes so should be around that timing ba
Remember to cut your hair before you go for the medical check up. Ears and forehead must not be covered by any part of your hair. The photo will be used for your 11B until you MR.
">i heard that u have to stand butt naked and they will ask u to cough. Is it true?

Hence you'll have to drop your pants. They're looking for signs of hernia"
so we have to take off everything?
do we have to wait for our turn in our undies?
"No just your pants, it takes like a second"
"No, you will have to take off your shirt while waiting for ECG, but you will only drop your pants when ur in a room 1 on 1 with the MO"
why everyone got different one sia some say need strip naked some say only pants

"I got pes E1,is it stay out everyday?what are my chances of getting posted to security trooper?"
There is really a library in camp?😂
"Unfortunately, they’ll always somehow find you a job. This applies to police, army or CD. I’ve met 2 pes e guys who used to clean up the officers mess for the whole of their ns life. Think of mess halls as a mini resort/restaurant. It was used probably twice a year in my camp. After breakfast, dust here n there. That’s it. The rest of the time u just do whatever you want until it’s time to go home at 4 or 5pm."
Yes PES E definitely stay out everyday. Nobody knows the chances. But you defo can only be an ASA or service security trooper
"Whether you are a stay out or not depends on your unit and its practises. If there is a need for you to stay in, you would have to.

As for chances of becoming an ST, i am not too sure."
SAFTI got library
That’s not definitely true lol I’m in driver course rn and there’s a pes E rec with us and we’re a stay in course
"Not necessarily stay out. Only those with psychological issues get to stay out (fear of suicide) and even then, I'm sure there are exceptions. Some units care less and may let Pes E soldiers do things not normally allowed but it's hush hush."
BS
"I'm PES E1, an ASA and was originally stay-in but needed to get excused for medical reasons. Being PES E doesn't automatically guarantee a stay-out vocation."
Pes e driver? I’m a driver myself and I’ve never heard of pes e driver. That’s new. LOLOL
I know 1 guy in my PES E9 BMT mate also post to driver course but other of my BMT mate is ASA but for me is SA so only 2 of us have to say goodbye to the BMT mate non of us got post to security trooper anyway.

"You will still need to use a rifle to defend yourself. Once you enlist, you will learn Basic Close Combat Training (BCCT) using your rifle in case you ran out of ammo during war time.

You will probably still need to go outfield with your rifle but you may not be required to draw live rounds/blanks and participate in live firing."
"I personally have never met anyone excused ammo but I’m guessing you’re pes c or something? The bmt is modified to accommodate different health conditions so it’s possible that u won’t have to touch a rifle. Most likely after u pop, you’ll be a clerk."
I think you watch war or sci-fi movie too much already lol even thought i like to watch war or sci-fi movie but real life it way opposite
"I'm assuming you're pes c/e. Theres 2 types of excuses regarding firearms. Yours means that you cannot shoot live rounds but you will get to do IMT (shooting range) and hold the rifle. You will go through the weapons presentation and they will teach you how to clean the rifle and stuff (similar to tekong). However after BMT, most likely you won't touch firearms ever again cos high chance you'll get a support vocation. The other excuse is ""excuse handling of firearms"" which means you won't even get to hold a rifle for your NS life."
what pes are you?
"if no excuse firearms, likely have to draw arms. even unrelated things like route march needs you to hold it for the weight without ammo."
"PTP and BP have one significant difference which is one is fit and the other is not fit. PTP is for people who did not pass their IPPT, hence they need the 2 months training to build their fitness before advancing to the official 2 months BMT. BP wise, you will need to be more fit because obese, hence BP need 3 months more as there will be a lot physical training to bring your BMI down and ensure that you are fit before advancing to official BMT. PTP will always be pes fit no matter what after finishing BMT assuming no injuries or no down pes. BP wise, if your BMI is still overweight after BMT, high chance your PES will not be PES A/B1, will be B2 and below depending on the severity of your obeseness and any underlying medical conditions. For your question, only the last 2 months of BMT will be the same for both PTP and Obese. If you got PES A/B1 after your BP BMT, you are already deemed to complete your BMT so there will be no such thing as PTP again. Not sure about your question about different times but PTP and Obese batch are 2 different things. Hence, I strongly encourage to try to lose your weight before enlisting if you wanna go command school or wanna be A/B1."

"Hi, are you from JC? If so, could you enlighten me how did you pass your ippt? Is it different from poly IPPT? I'm struggling to even hit 13 mins for my 2.4km..."
"Here are some tips to ace your 2.4km:

1. Do progressive runs at your own pace (build up the distance (1.6km, 1.8km, 2.0km etc) and not just aim for 2.4km, best is to aim for 3km so that your body will get used to the distance and you won't feel so shag when you are about to hit 2.4km)
2. Once you are comfortable with running 3km, do a progressive timed run (set your own target and reduce it by 10-20 sec for each run).
3. Do speed running (run 200m, jog 200m and repeat the process. Once you get the hang of it, increase the run distance and reduce the jogging distance)
4. Land your feet properly (land with your heel first and lift with the end of your toes, basically is a full foot landing at each step)
5. Regulate your breathing (breathe in and out slowly, once you control your breathing, your heart will pump slower and you won't feel so exhausted so easily)
6. Lastly, do proper warm up especially on your legs (stretch your hamstring, calves, knees, thighs and also your ankle so that your legs are 'ready"" to deal with the constant impact of running and do the same for your cooldown so that you won't have muscle ache the next day)."
"Yes I'm from JC so I can't comment on poly IPPT though I'll ask my poly friends who are in year 2 now and see if they know a thing or two. 

>If so, could you enlighten me how did you pass your ippt?

Honestly, considering my weight and BMI I really don't know how to answer. I'm not really fat but I'm not muscular either, neither do I do sports a lot. I'm just big and tall, though I was in good shape back in Sec 4. I just know that I'm okay in push ups and sit ups so I didn't really do much. 

But for running it was a little bit tricky. See I got like 14min 57s for the 1st test and that's because my endurance was like shit. So I got a friend of mine (who's 9min something) to be my pacemaker (idk if that's the term) but basically he runs with me to help push me on and make me reach my target. I didn't exercise or train between the first test and the second, but it was because of him that I managed to reach 12 min 43s which is a big improvement. 

So tldr, probably get a friend who's good at running and can help you run at an appropriate pace."
Thanks so much for the advice! Is it good to run 4/5 days per week to improve?
"> probably get a friend who's good at running and can help you run at an appropriate pace.

Have to second this. In BMT I was ok at running but the main way I kept pace in IPPT was to run with one of my bunkmates whose timing was slightly faster than me.

It helps a lot more than you think to have a pacekeeper. Even if they're a bit slower, having a voice or presence around to keep you running and push you to not stop is also important."
"Depends on your body condition and adjust accordingly, what I would do is run 1 day rest 1 day for my muscle to recover. But the improvement is not that significant as compared to running 5 days a week."
"Give your camp's dental clinic a call to schedule for an emergency appointment. If your camp does not have a dental clinic, they may refer you to go for another camp's dental clinic.

If the pain is affecting your daily activities or even sleep, it is considered as an emergency already. Remember to highlight to the clinic about the pain intensity (1 to 10) so that they can give you priority.

Intense pain could be factors like your tooth is starting to get impacted and is cutting thru the surface of your gums or it could be decayed etc."
Call them up and say it’s pain! They will schedule u forward
What you’re feeling is actually considered an emergency. They will accommodate you. Just call them up and say the painkillers doing jackshit. They’ll either give u stronger painkillers or refer you to ktph.
"Every other booking is after my ORD, this slot was one I got after some dude suddenly cancelled surgery. Gotta hang on for that NS coverage"

Usually people cancel their appointments during the day/close to end of working hours and the slot is left unfilled. I got my medical review pushed forward by a whole month by calling in."

Im not sure about the down pes procedure but you can pass your memo from outside doctor to MO. You wont get charged for that. If you think you back is gonna hurt you in the future and want advices on downpes. They wont charge you for anything.
"my med centre tell me i have to get my S1 to book, no walk ins allowed sia"
"yes u can.  sometimes some medical centre medics may ""play by the book"" and insist that you book a medical review appointment first but it all depends on the MO.  so far all the MOs I've seen when I walked-in to RSI entertained my requests w/o much fuss"
then you explain to your S1 that your back pain is really unbearable ba. I think back pain until cmi. really cannot fake de so yeah
Act blur live longer just walkin and say that since you're already there might as well just do a review if not just scan 11B before they say anything
"Check with your superior. Usually time chit will warrant absence from something (like I am out of camp for half a day and I get a time chit), but it's NOT an M.C.  
  
M.C. lasts whole day, or a few days, time chit is a few hours."
"time what? time chit?
anyway ask your superior about it they won't bite"
"Why can’t you just tell him the appointment timing? Just get a time sheet from the physiotherapist to cover you - if you’ve made the appointment, told your encik the correct time, and have documentary evidence from the public hospital, you have a bulletproof paper trail."
"1. If you raise it up as a safety hazard then they dont have the right to force you. Let him bring it up to your csm or someone higher up to make the call.

2. You are lucky enough that you no need to clean the ceiling fan. I personally do not think theres much of a hazard cleaning the wall fan.

3. How difficult is it to open up the case of the fan and removing the blade to clean? If you really that afraid then just undo the case and use wet tissue lor.

4. Its important to keep your fans clean. The dust on the blade and case may trap virus or causes allergy to someone. To keep it clean reduce it, and also makes the wind cooler and more powerful. 

Lastly cannot be fan you also want SAF to outsource cleaner to come clean for you right? Then next time others will say i cannot sweep the floor. Later i trip on the broom whilst sweeping. I cannot walk down the stairs, later i forget hold railing then i slip. Safety hazard. Tio bo?"
"If this was a hall fan which is mounted high up, then yes OSHA would protect you. But calling the hotline just to because you were asked to clean a bunk ceiling fan? Turn off the fan, wear your helmet if you're concerned about safety, black tape a cloth to a broom, request a table.. use your brain.

Fans are designed to be cleaned, but it sounds like you're being asked to dismantle it.

As a soldier, do you think the cleaner aunties and uncles (if there are any) receive certificates to clean your bunk fans?"
"I have cleaned that fan multiple times during NS.


We used to sit on the cabinet and slowly remove the casing before wiping the casing and the fan blades.


Honestly if it drops just use your hands to hold it as a precaution. The entire process is not that difficult.


You don't need to be trained to do this. Somethings can be figured out via trial and error. And even if you break it, hey it belongs to the army. At most you write a statement. Think of it as a free lesson to learn how to clean a fan so that when your future spouse asks for  your help, you won't give her the ''i m not fan-cleaning trained'' reaction.


Yes it is not 100% safe, and you are not wrong to raise it up if you dont feel like doing it or if you just want to screw with your superior.  But pls dont carry this attitude outside of army, it is laughable."
"Honestly, there’s no wrong cleaning a side fan on the side. Bro there’s lots of households using those kind of fans and people still clean it either way. If the fan is dirty it’s for ur own health and good to clean it. I don’t see anything to be brought up to the safety hotline. If u can’t even clean a side wall fan, I have serious doubts on how do u clean ur household fans should the need arises."
"You can raise it up to the next chain of command. If nothing is done, safety hotline definitely can be called. Cleaning fans in SAF require external parties as it pose certain risk and hazard. Safety is the top priority! Please stay safe!"
"Nah. You confirm plus chop ASA or service ST. Won’t even go outfield or touch SAR21. In your BMT you will touch SAR21, but following unit life you never see SAR21 anymore."
Not sure if there were any recent changes but having long hair was fine for ippt.
"You are referring to those IPPT that you are taking at the FCC/Safra? If it is, yes. No hair length/colour restriction."
thanks for the reply dude!
thanks for replying!
"usually after field camp everyone will be super busy cleaning their stuff (field packs, LBS, etc). Back in my field camp last year, we only managed to return to bunk at 1am so it's pretty normal"

Thanks so much!
Bro I also wanna know I'm in fit intake cm say CEO is the only non-frontline vocation for us
NSOSO is also possible for fit intake. It is office hour and deployable for operations. But most of the time it is staff work.
Don’t think so. I think this is only for infantry officers and regulars who volunteer to do it.
"For NSFs, only Infantry/Guards/Commando officers.

For regulars, if you want to volunteer to go for it regardless of vocation you can go for it."
They always ask where is chao recoot who is late for fall out not how is chao recoot who is late for fall out
This depends on your vocation... What’s signals one btw?
I guess it’s the usual field pack and rifle
then thats no diff with SOC what... I thought signals got a fast march 1km and team of 4 under 19 min or smth?
I guess I have to rephrase the qns to SOC
"You can't reject any postings, since you are not given a choice to be offered anything. 

The only time you can straight up say you do not want to go command school is the Express Interest form. Other than that, no."
just say no on your EI form?
I believe you can tell them straight up when you enter either of the command schools. Do let them know your preferences and your reason behind if possible. Usually OOC is quite common sight anyways.
"I’m from mono and my sarg said it’s possible, and you would be sent back to the mono peeps. But idk if he talking cock or he being legit"
Y did u not just choose to be a man when they asked for ur interests?? Nvrm just take mc until u ooc or ask doctor for downpes
"just let them know that you aren’t interested in being a commander on the first day, its not uncommon to see people OOC-ing within the first week. you can say you changed your mind after submitting your EI form or something. all the best. happy cny!"
No. Moving on
Definitely no
"Ask your OC, my batch did it in the last 2 months but they booked for us."
"Iirc once u r within 3 months of ur ORD date can book alr. Need to do dental, blood and admin. Check with your officer to see which dental centre serves your cluster."
"Generally speaking your unit should arrange the dates for you. Normally you start clearing your FFI in the last 2-3 months, I doubt people start clearing them as early as 6 months."
the FFI is valid for 3 months only so do it within 3 months of your ord date. You will need to book a dental with your camp cluster's dental center afterwards approach your S1 to book a blood draw and admin consult with your camp's medical center
"if ur on long term status they’ll only post you out once your status ends, hearsay it’s so they can post you back to your combat unit provided you don’t downpes"
"I OOC'ed in SCS Pro term (Recon Commander Course) due to ankle ligament injury as well, will be consulting for surgery tomorrow after months of physio. Personally, being a SIT was the easiest part of my NS life and I had so much freedom and free time as a SIT CPL. Covid had just hit at that time too, so all the ooc guys kept taking 5 days mc every week lmao. Normally ooc guys get posted out when that SCS batch graduates, usually to a camp near where you live. Hence why, me being in the east got posted to Guards as a spec. You being from a mono intake batch most definitely means they want to send you back to your mono unit. Probably waiting for an open slot for your unit's HQ/till your status ends and you can become a trooper again. Though it is common and I have heard of SCS schools trying to hold guys as much as possible for themselves as it's extra manpower. I know an OOC SIT guy who had supported 3 different batches of cadets lmao. If you've gone to your S1 and OC, then there's nothing else that can be done but wait. See the psychologist/counsellor at Pasir Laba Camp, I heard she's very nice. If you're interested, a friend easily Chao keng and got excuse stay in from her which might make life more bearable. But honestly life is shit for everyone in NS, don't matter if you're a driver, rifleman or clerk (though I'm a bit jealous of the NSFs who are receptionists for physio and dental centres), just gotta deal with it and keep moving forward."
dude what’s the pay in scs if u don’t mind compared to a recruit
"I'm in a very similar position to you rn. I was 04/20 batch that POPed in Dec. During my block leave I got a slight fracture on my foot rendering me unable to report to my posting (SCS). My MC finished around a month ago and I was told to report back where I did my BMT, which was 7coy of BMTC Sch 4. Because I missed my posting, I'm awaiting a new one as I have been temporarily down pes until May. I have been here a month now and still no posting. I was told by my commanders it usually takes a minimum of a week up to 2 months before people get reposted. 

When I was in BMT there was a guy who was staying in the room beside me who had been waiting about 2 months before finally getting posted out. I feel your pain bro hopefully we get our postings soon :')"
"I would say, try making connections with superiors or other people you contact for logistics etc. Cause down the line, you might never know if you need their help once you get posted out."
"From Admin (equivalent to S1). due to covid there is a delay in posting from CPC. Some ooc waited many mths before posting out. Your unit won't have much say in your posting as CPC is the one deciding. Unless they can keep u for recourse or as storeman/asa. 

So they r right that u can only wait for an ans. Ur s1 prolly try chasing for an ans. But ur status and medical condition might be delaying it.

I suggest you to take it easy. Avoid any activity that can exacerbate your injury. Pls pls see MO if u can't cope or the encik make u do things that u can't or exacerbate ur injury. 

Posting =/ defined job scope. I have ASA in my unit that have no job scope and all he do is clean the floor, sleep and some misc. Not much difference from u."
"hi, i had a ligament tear in my knee too right before ns. just keep going to see MO, hopefully find an understanding one that will downpes u to b3/b4 like i did. if they want to recourse its up to u but i advise not to with your injury as it can really f u up bad again. I too was stuck for a long time doing nothing. if u want u could try to find a way (allergy) to stay out and enjoy your time better. no need ps, once u ord no one gives a shit anymore. 

also dont understand why it wouldnt be downpes-able. its as serious a physical injury as it gets and renders u incapable of many exercises."
Army alway like to drag things. Like mine unit some need to re-bmt but drag until ORD not need to go. They just relax stay at coy do shit job or paper work.
"Guessing here.  Mono Intake from 42 SAR.  Serving National Service, you didn't sign on right?  


**Affecting Posting**?  
What are you aiming for? Chief Defense Force?  


Decade may seem very long time for you now.  But in a Decade plus later(assuming 10++ years of Reserves) you will hang up your Number Four and De-kit your gear.  


But that **Injury that Gotten you OOC**, may still be there.  It is common, for some to be aches/problems that incurred in National Service.     


Most Singaporean are not that active as in the past, Mind nimble, but body not so.  
Give the Body time to heal, if possible learn skills other that what SCS ""teaches"" ie doing Stores, Logistic training carries into Civilian Life, how to bargain and gain trust and material - Useful for Life.  


Postings.    
Hanging around SCSs, outside the Syllabus, treat it as a Holiday, Good Learning Experience."
Yeah I heard about this too. I find it stupid cos my injury is pretty permanent (ligament tear) but it doesn’t seem to be a down pes-able thing.
"Ive seen her. Can confirm really nice experience.  Came out of it with some coping mechanisms!
For me, being a PTE, I will have less clearance than a CPL, so probably relegated a shittier job. Regardless, i am not being mistreated in my SCS coy and even have a good working relationship with my CQ, CWO and most, if not all of the perm staff. I just posted to see if its possible to speed up the process of posting out as a few of us have been waiting for something that is not coming and the ad hoc nature of our job is abit unbearable and taking its toll on us."
755 without combat pay
"It's similar to CPL pay, maybe $10-20 more only. Which is why if you OOC in pro term you become a CPL."
All the best to us!
Woah thanks for the look behind the curtain. Yeah I agree with the last part and hence have abit of reluctance to push for my posting. Just trying to see if others are in my shoes as well
Apparently ankle ligament tears are not ss serious
Not aiming high lah. Cannot really say its a holiday also cos Im also being worked till Im feeling burnt out. (storeman cum ASA add on top of that random saikang being thrown and occasional surprise weekend duty). Seeking a permanent posting to something with a clearly defined role instead of being called an SIT and treated as a multi tool.
"Theres a fine line btn ""treat it as learning experience"" and forced to pick up stuff along the way cuz you getting farmed like a dog altho u not even supposed to be farmed. Maybe thats why hes depressed and wants a permanent posting. Re-read your reply a few times, i trust you probably had good intentions but i dont think you really are getting the full picture. If he was living a good life as being a stand in ASA or storeman he wont be developing symptoms of depression, just sayin."
Ask your specialist for a letter to down pes. Pretty sure ligament tears that require surgery would need you to downpes and undergo physio for years.
"Did you OOC early in the course? My friend got injured late in foundation term, that let him post out to pro term and ooc from there so that he could jump to CPL. Plus you are eligible for 3SG promotion once you complete your found term regardless of SCS completion, and like myself, most do get the spec promotion. So I currently have 3SG pay and combat pay while mainly in an office role as a PES B4. But yeah, nothing else you can do if your S1 and OC can't/won't do anything. Unless you wanna go talk to one of your ministers lol.

Edit: actually if you're desperate, it might be a good idea to let your status expire and get posted back to your unit. You get your post out. Then at Gedong just report sick again and push for downpes. You're mono so there's almost no escaping going back to your unit anyways. My status expired before I got posted out and I got an office job anyways, and then downpes and got new status after posting out at Guards. If you got any related skills in, media, design, music, you can also try asking your S1 to send in a request to post you to Guards lol, for NDP2021 planning and prep which is already underway. That's the only way I see you dodging going back to 42 SAR."
"fk them. go specialist say its damn painful. thing is it may not be SUPER serious to the pt u cannot do anything, but all you need is ONE exercise that pushes u a bit too far to mess u up for life. and chances are they WILL push u. personally hence i wouldnt/didnt feel bad for playing up my injuries when i needed to. if anything say while at home u tried to train then it recurred. things like that. make it as serious as possible! its up to u but thats my thoughts frm my experience :)"
"Wait, are you referring to Singapore Armed Forces?
Made of up Singaporean? Whom changes their mind at a wimp, want the best, cheap and fast?

OOC maybe the best thing that happened to you."
"Question,

How long has this ""farmed like a dog"" lasted, 3 months +, and developing symptoms of what?  Have some compassion to those assigned to doing stores after BMT, I work with various levels. Storemen very strong bonds, they work together and rest together.

Procedural wise,  Generally the headcount of the Company is as specified by the Orbat, how many of various staff at what level, adding one personal requires sign off at various levels, aka lots of paperwork.

Trainees come in as a Batch, distributed and held at the various levels (Company)  
End of Course, results submitted, used to be CPC, and a list of Postings is Generated to the Trainees.  
And they goes to their way, OCS for the top few, Further courses for those vocations, back to Unit for the rest that passed.

OOC, case by case basis, as there are mant reason for OOC, most common is injuries. Some Units (especially Mono-intakes) don't want the injured personal back, as it reduces there effective Headcount.

For SCS, Known of cases OOCs, assuming they are Fit For Instructions, held back to the next run of the similar course.  Those whom are unable to join the next batch, luck of the draw.

Stability
2020 have concretely demonstrated People Desires and want for Stability, but Mother Nature will throw a spanner into everyone routine.

Sorry, but the quick you get used to Life that is chaotic, easier is life for you, even after the end of National Service."
I asked my specialist. Straight up told me won’t reccomend until next review haha.
Quite late but i missed the high keys. Probably had 3 weeks left in found term
[deleted]
"I used my nuclear option of asking my specialist, if i sustain anymore injury due to he unwillingness to write a letter, would he be responsible for my injury. Helps that’s my parents were there. He though of it and wrote the letter. Of course this is the last case scenario."
No you both
"I had a back injury from live heli rappel. I pushed thru. It was initially bearable for 1st 3 years. Many years later, I cant sit or stand or run or lie down without feeling some kind of pain. Fix yourself when it’s not too late. I only got downgraded 2 years before I mr. I suffered in every ict. It’s not worth it."
"Do it downpes if you think this injury is hurting your future

Tbh this is why i rejected the commando invitation. SAF already has this toxic masculinity mindset. Commando formation just adds fuel to the fire with the excessive ego. 

No point destroying your life for the 2 years of shouting FGH. You go out work. Some clerk who never even pass bmt in tekong could be your boss, what is red beret or airborne badge or commando formation badge gonna do for you then? Think of the long route. Army is not your life forever"
"Former commando here. Down PES. Just do it. 

We have had people basically unable to walk properly and permanently damaged their back or legs because they didn’t want to listen to the rest of us and wanted to push through the pain. 72KM Ain’t a joke. And even after that you’ll be walking a lot with heavy af loads

Don’t listen to those people that say you’re a pussy if you down PES. Those people are idiots and your true brothers will be happy to see you go if it means that you keep your health.

Once you OOC you’ll likely be reassigned to a clerical position etc in the camp or assigned out so you’ll do your reservist there."
"First, help yourself by bothering to go for the MRI scan."
"downpes please. was in gds and had a knee ligament tear. they were totally not understanding and made me carry jerrycans etc as ‘storeman’. looking back that was pretty f-ed up and really hindered my recovery. till now my knee is still quite loose but it doesnt affect me day to day. if i fall on it again im screwed. like others said, fix your body before its not too late. if you want to be in cdo ask yourself why. its 2 yrs and no one outside cares about what happened in ns. i got posted to driver and had as good an ns experience i cld hope for. just my 2 cents"
"A true leader will never put his/her men in jeopardy by just assuming anyone is trying to keng if they voice out regarding physical pain or mental stress to him/her. True leaders have empathy and compassion and foresight and lead others with kindness not bravado and arrogance. Sad to say, most leaders are not true leaders and do not practice servant leadership. How many men can really say their leader is such a good leader that they would be willing to lay down their lives for their leader? One false assumption by a leader which translates into a tragedy is one mistake too many and sadly we have knowledge of more than one such incident over the past few years. Take care of yourself first and do not expect others to look out for you if you find the culture toxic. It takes bravery to take care of oneself and do not let what the others say or do affect your decision to do so."
Please go for your MRI scan.
"Just downpes. I left CDO right after BMT and got downpes months later. Everyone kept telling me to reconsider and I'm glad I didn't. 

Years later and my lower limbs are still hurting. Honestly, it's not worth it. I had way more fun and satisfaction in my new unit anyways, no regrets."

31 Alpha or 32 Bravo?
Is Dr Nathaniel still there?
courage dispels fear or swift and deadly?
"That’s so disheartening to hear, and it’s scary as well because that’s very close to what I am feeling. Constant discomfort in my lower back. May I know how you go about downgrading after NS? (in case i fail to do so right now)"
"Yes, there’s crazy amount of toxic masculinity here. It’s always “commando” this, “commando” that. Constant reminder why they are the “best” lmao. It’s a joke really. 

Thank you for your advice. Army is really not my life. I should look ahead and see my long-term goal :)"
Thank you. This sounds like a rational thing to do. Were in the same shoes as me before?
"I agree with you. The reason why I chose to forgo that was because the commanders have very negative connotations against people who go for MRI (very evident), as it usually brings them on the path to OOC/downpes, also I do not want to be “marked”. 

I have witnessed first hand how my friends who go on that path has been ignored by our commanders and seen as geng-ing or “mind weak” LOL, and delaying their post out by making them do as many saikang as possible during their LD period. It’s insane. 

But i guess that’s one more reason why I shouldn’t stay here anymore."
"That’s so common. So much for promoting “safety” in SAF. Excused heavy load, but told to carry Jerry cans and do stores lol..."
Not sure who he is 😅
"I really only sought help when I orded. 1st got a referral from polyclinic. Got referred to sgh but for years all I got was just physio and medication. They didn’t bother doing an mri. It got so bad to the point where I was having problems walking after 7 years. I then requested to see a specialist and I got a scan within a week. Turns out I had a small fracture in my spine, a missing disc and 1 bulging disc. Was immediately downgraded to pes c with the diagnosis of “extreme exercise”. 

So my advice is to go to a private gp. Get a referral to see a specialist. You’ll save shitloads of time. It’ll cost under $800 in total."
The medical officers in camp have to stick to a quota. In my case almost everyone had back problems due to heavy loads so he really had no choice but to only investigate more serious cases. So your best bet is private drs.
"yep. hahah heard couple years back they sang about beating and ejaculating on girls, somehow the guys inside found it funny to the pt they told their gfs (my friends) who raged, obviously."
"Nope I managed to finish the entire thing without any injuries but I have one friend that will walk with a limp for the rest of his life because he didn’t want to listen to us and pushed himself till his ACL and a couple of other muscles tore (he had to go for rehab just to walk without crutches again) . I have another that feels permanent back pain now and one more that can’t walk for more than 30 minutes because the cartilage in his joints are all worn down. 

We told all of them to stop but they all kept pushing."
"Sorry, if I'm blunt because it just seems like you're giving yourself excuses. If you think I'm here to console you, give you the attention, and convince you then you're wrong.

If u want help, get it sorted."
"
yeap. as others have suggested, downpes is the way to go. reservist also easier in the future, also i ord-ed 4months ago so the memories of pre-downpes are still fresh. can safely say if you downpes, life will probably pass slower but youll be way more relaxed. army always felt like a cloud over my head. wake up late gg. overslept as a driver like 3 times and never got punished. (shhh!)"
"Thank you, this is really helpful, I appreciate it. May I know if this $800 is covered or was it out of your own pocket?"
"Yes, I have witnessed how some of them was really reluctant to give my friend MC although he could barely walk. Just an LD..."
Difficult to deny that this never happened
"No worries, I understand you. The fact that I am indecisive is the problem."
800 out of pocket. Which is really nothing compared to all the bullshit I went thru.
"Speaking as a dude who ooc from scs for the most easy thing to label as chao keng(anxiety/adjustment disorder), just fucking do it. Army is not worth your health, saf doesn't give 2 shits about you, better to go at least get it checked than risk a permanent injury."
"Thank you. The more i see it, SG army is really not what I thought it was. I hope your condition is getting better now."
"Maybe in some units, life is better. But commando diff story lmao

I'm doing much better thanks :)"
"Hi, 

Differs from batch to batch, but combat fit usually almost definitely disrupts (A, B1, B2). In fact PES C also usually disrupts. 

The occasional people that I heard were not disrupted were PES E people (even so, some PES E people will disrupt). But must at least pass BMT last I heard. 

Best time to downpes is after BMT. 100% make sure you have already finished the course, turned private before pursuing downpes. 
If you have already passed 2 out of 3 of BTP, IPPT and Field Camp, you have technically already passed BMT unless your OC wants to OOC you. (Though most will not because it looks bad to have a low passing rate for a company)."
Thanks!
actually curious what would happen if you get an STD during service
what to expect from c9 school 5 recourse bmt?
Is it possible for SCDF and SAF NSmen to do IPPT in the same session? My friend and I are in different orgs and we want to complete IPPT together but we're not sure if it's possible.
i’m going for my medical check up in a few weeks and i have no idea on what to expect. Someone pls run me through on what’s gonna happen in detail. Thx!
"Hi all, I,M19, am going into SPF for NS. In a few days time, I'll be heading to HTA for the 10 day training stay in training session. 

Should I shave before I enter or can I keep my hair during the 10 days there?
Sorry if it seems like a stupid question but when I asked friends and family, I cannot get a definitive answer.

Thanks in advance!!"
"Not much tbh, was from bmtc5 also, 9 weeks regular bmt 4 weeks vocational training, most of that time will be admin time, iron bedsheet, no shellscrape and no outfield, just slack most of the time."
Yes possible
All will become botak but it is easier if you don't shave and come in as the barbers are just weird and will still cut your already very short hair by that insignificant amount. Just a reminder that the haircut is $2. And are you pes E? Only pes e have a 10 day course in spf
"No, I'm PES B1"

"So after the 10th days, the 3/5 months is to train physical fitness?"
[deleted]
"So after the 10 days, I will be able to book in and out for the next 3/5 months, presumably for the weekend and national holidays, correct? When can I start asking to take personal day/leave after that 10 days or is it only possible after the 3/5 months?"
[deleted]
Ok thanks!! I got more info from this than all of my friends and family I'd asked.
"It depends actually. 

Normally for poly graduates, CMPB would send you your enlistment letter 2-4 months before your enlistment date for PTP (2 months before) or enhanced BMT (4 months before).

I received my enlistment letter 4 months before (enhanced BMT).

Upcoming enlistment dates: [https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/web/portal/cmpb/home/before-ns/enlistment-dates](https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/web/portal/cmpb/home/before-ns/enlistment-dates)

Not so sure for drop outs, from what I can see from the CMPB website, your earliest possible enlistment should be on April as it is not possible for you to enlist next week (for February) and there is no enlistment on March.

You can call CMPB (during office hours) to ask regarding your enlistment date due to drop out."
"Nobody knows man, I waited like half a year and enlisted in October.I dropped out too."
"If u wanna enlist before 18, u need to request. They will only call u up after ur 18th birthday. If u r alr pass 18, then idk why tho."
ave about 1-2 mths
Should come with the following monthly allowance
"If during ict, then abt 1 -2 weeks after payday"
Normally now IPPT if you have paynow can get instantly. But marksman wise 1-2 months.
"IPPT money usually comes the next month you get it. E.g If you successfully get IPPT gold/silver on for example 23rd Feb, you will receive the money in April 10th. 

At least that's the trend I see for my unit. 

Marksmen wise IDK. Cuz some of my mates that went ATP last year November 2020 achieved marksmen but have not received the money yet because apparently their BTP are not correctly registered in system."
After SCGP when u return ur number 1 (for signallers)
"Usually, it’ll be on the last day of SCS or thereabouts."
current batch (46/20) will officially receive on 18 feb

It's under the medical certificate portion.
If the MC portion is empty it's quite likely that you have no excuse status. It could be a system fault so do check with your Sgt/PS/PC to have them check from their side.
Email CMPB if its not on safhealth
Thanks bro
Oh but there is nothing there. I clearly told that I'm sensitive to a few things. Should I call up MINDEF in that case ?
Actually I'm a pre enlistee. Forgot to mention
Alright thanks!
I see.The PES and Excuses status usually comes out together so in your case its still very likely you are not excused anything but still check with them on the first day.
Doesn't that mean the excuse list will actually come out on your enlistment day? Because the excuses will start from your enlistment day
"Hey! I love the app given I’m ORDing (not soon enough) - not an ORNS feature but have you considered a tab for MAs and “other” events to be recorded down? (I.e. external events, exams, that sort of thing - it would be completely aesthetic and I just use the exercise/duty tabs, but I feel it could help with the UI!)"
"hey man, what language are u coding this on?"
Thank you! I love this
"Love the app!

Would prefer the IPPT/BMI sections to be left blank if there isn't manual input as some of us aren't eligible for IPPT.

Maybe under contacts you could separate the tabs into General/Helplines/Medical/Dental? Also would like the option to change my wallpaper.

Will be clicking on ads occasionally so hopefully you can get yourself something from the canteen (I doubt it wi be enuf tho 😅)"
Thanks for your feedback! I will try best in my free time to implement👍🏽
I am using Flutter Framework (dart language). It is pretty new but the community is growing with good documentations. IOS is swift and Android is Kolin.
"Thanks man! yeah creating separate tabs sounds great. IPPT/BMI, I will try my best to find a way bc still a noob. The ads don't give much, but it is the thoughts that matter(Rate my app too😬)👍🏽"
ahh no wonder the ui looks familiar. thanks!
"Are you using adsense? How do ads work, like does it give the same amount every time I play an ad, or does it decrease if it senses I'm spamming it. Also, does it give more based on engagement metrics and are they tracking those (click to visit download link/downloading app etc)"
You're welcome.
"I am using Admob. Tell u the truth, it is mainly educating myself on how to implement ads. I will not earn much if the target audience is small but at least is something ($0.20 per dayish). Hopefully, I can break even the cost for the developer account ($150 per year🙄).

security trooper
Police force lmao
Urrr... I know St troopers as well as... Some active units are 2 in 2 out. Artillery? Maybe. Been a while.
Military Police Air Base 😋
"Army Intelligence, that's what I heard from my friend."
not like u can choose ur vocation. but usually things that require shift work or long duties.
"well tbh we cannot choose what vocation to do in NS.

as per my understanding. ST leh usually in 2 in 2 out. I believe there are other vocation too."
[deleted]
^ but keep in mind this depends on what camp you get posted to.
police force isn't a vocation LOL. its separate on its own.
read you karen

"If u shave outside, the barber in HTA will still have to touch up on ur hair if it is not up to their liking. So might as well do it when you're in HTA"
"Always shave at a salon or barber. I did my pre-enlistment haircut at Snip Avenue for around $3.80. Just tell the barber army haircut and he/she will do the rest.

Best timing to shave is about 1 day before your enlistment."
"Just bring a $2 note and cut it in HTA. Also all the best!! You'll be the 183 intake. I'm still in HTA so you can clarify any doubts with me, just drop me a pm"
Do enlistment day. If nt up to standard. They will cut for u again.
"If you or your friends have the shaver then cut on your own for free. Go salon I think $10?

Inside camp cut is $2 for SAF, the rest should be the same.

I would say cut outside, so that you can go back to bunk and lepak or sort your stuff out. Unless your commanders want everyone to wait together. Cut the day before to be safe."
"Don’t listen to these clowns and just get it cut one or two days before enlistment. Ask for number 1 from your barber and don’t cut any fanciful outlines or slope of any kind. Saves you time since you don’t have to cut again, and don’t have to spend several hours(depending on efficiency), till you’re allowed to bathe after your haircut."
"Cut at a salon 1-2 days max before you enlist. The salon barber will probably do a better job than the barber in your camp, who will most likely just anyhow shave and make it uneven.

Ask for Number 1 haircut aka army head haircut and the salon barber will do the rest. Do it at snip avenue (around $3.80 but long queue) or do it at any salons that cost less than $10 will do.

Do it as cheaply as you can, you will be cutting your hair at least once every 2-3 weeks."
"In the long run it doesn't matter. You get to spend a few more minutes in bunk to socialize, or you sit in queue for a $2 cut and socialize.

If you like publicizing your life on social media, get your friends/family to cut your hair at home #hormatsaf #loyaltocountry etc...

Most ppl will need to cut agn because their hair too long. But no one cares how your hair looks in BMT."
Didnt cut before enlistment because I dont to waste  my civilian time knowing that I’m already going to spend 2 years in NS.
[deleted]
It should be fully bald?thinking of cutting on my own before i enlist.(btw i am a pre enlistee who is still waiting for pes status😂)
People talk about enlistment you talk about pop for what? Tf?
Not fully bald like skinhead that kind. It is slightly longer than a monk’s baldhead.
"I think the machine won't count your pushups so might fail IPPT? 

Think the most important is to try correct your form first, like do lesser push up slowly with proper form and see if it works. No point doing so many but the machine doesn't count any"
Then you’re not doing 40 push ups.
"All you will hear is no count, no count, no count, no count."
"If you can't do proper push ups in NS, then you will have problems in your IPPT's Push Up Station during your NS and the annual IPPT requirement you need to take once every birthday window.

The eliss system's push up station will have a camera to take note of your back (from head to neck to backbone to hip to legs) to ensure a straight line and determine that as a benchmark for your reps. Chances are each of your push up will not be registered as a rep if your backbone is curving and the machine will prompt you to straighten your back."
"Then you can’t do 40 pushups without your back curving ?? Train more with proper form lor ?? 

What do you expect us to say ? You already know the reason why you arent doing proper pushups so perhaps go work on it instead of posting lmao.

all ur post so boliao one pls stop wasting our time."
I am probably gonna get pes c/e(i am a pre enlistee)
You have to take ippt every year?
Thats cause idk how to make my back straight to do push ups😂
Then you have nothing to worry about :-)
"For Combat Fit NSFs/NSmen, yes.

During NSF, you will need to take minimally once during your BMT, before end of first year and before you ORD. These three IPPTs are the minimum attempts you need to take if you are lucky to score well at each of the attempt. My NSF unit used to have a habit to conduct IPPT once a week.

After ORD, you will need to take once every birthday window (Opens on your birthday and closes on 1 day before your next birthday) until you are 40 years old for WOSE, 45 years old for Officers or until you fall under MINDEF Reserve (MR).

If you are downpes permanently to PES B3 and below (exclude C1), you don't have to take IPPT.

"then how you want us help you bro ? we cannot magically straighten your back through our text ? google how to straighten ur back lor .-.  


being pissed at you aside, try lie down flat then do pushups, record urself or get someone to correct your form. always tell yourself to straighten your back. Start from 1 then work your way up. Remember to throw all your thoughts of ""i can do 20/30 pushups away"" - be humble and correct your form."
"I mean my back is normally beny,so i have to make my back straight then try doing perfect push ups,btw thanks for the info,and i never told i needed help,i just wanna know what will happen😂"

"RM isn't a veto for BMT. IPPT pass, Field Camp (specifically fire movement), and BTP are and you have to recourse if you miss 2 out of 3.

So unless you are looking to go to command school, report sick and look after your health, since no one else will do that for you."
Better go report sick and get your knee treated. I did the same thing when I was in secondary school and just exercised the pain away. Ended up with chronic severe tendinopathy in my achilles tendon. Not worth.
"Ngl sounds like you’re hesitant to report sick cos you dont want to retake your high keys if you end up getting down time (medical excuse etc) if you report sick and tbh it’s normal to feel that way.

However, please do take care of yourself and report sick asap so that the issue doesn’t worsen. From my experience I foresee they will most likely refer you out for specialist review/X-Ray and give you maybe RMJ status for 1-2 weeks pending specialist review.

Regardless, please take care and don’t make it permanent. Re-doing some high keys >>>>>>>> having a busted knee for life"
"Your knees become stiff after not moving them for a while and sort of hurts when u extend ur leg? E.g sitting crossed legged for while then it hurts when u try to stand up, not specifically the knee but the general knee area?

Yea I had it too, i went and got an X-ray outside but doctors said nothing was wrong. Didn't check with MO in camp tho, the issue resolved itself after I pop from BMT and luckily got posted to a less physically intensive vocation.

If its interfering with activites tho, best to check with MO at least. At best might be a not so serious, but not unheard of issue MO see before, can give u some meds for it. At worst, its a problem and u get it sorted early."
"If you are asking a medical question, please ask your MO. They will be able to give you an accurate answer.

"Had the same issue as you, was gunning for command sch and this happened
Trust me, report sick and get a referral letter for it to see specialist 
Better treat it before it gets worse

Mine was not only knees but also my back, it’s been 6 months and my pain isn’t going away 🤡"
"Go report sick take arthritis level painkillers and pray to god, or report sick and lower chance for command school"
"report report report. ns is not worth to chiong sua. people at 40 50 their knee cmi kpkb, you want to be like them? i didnt so i fast game report sick ooc. everyone think i geng but its ok, ill laugh at them with my strong knees."
"please put your health first, even if you have to retake your high keys, your health should be your highest priority"
"I’m pretty sure you have an inflamed IT band. Do a Google search and try the stretches, you should be able to find relief pretty quickly. Not something you can get rid of during a high key. 

So if you want to finish your high key, just suck it up. If you think you don’t want to risk aggravated injury, then just report sick. Not that the MO can do anything for you other than prescribing pain killers/ anti inflammatory (if he even knows what’s an IT band), and a few rest days. But you will still have to suck it up and finish the rest of your high key."
Same here
this exact thing happened to me and went away when I got posted to a combat service support vocation.
"Yeah that’s what’s happening to me rn, but it also hurts during marching drills i.e. raising knee during sedia"
"Right now I’m in mono armoured infantry combat. But idk whether I can cover posted to support unit within 41SAR after POP, any idea?"
"my batch has shown that anything is possible, including mono to SPF. It's only a matter of whether you're lucky enough to be among the outliers 🙂"
