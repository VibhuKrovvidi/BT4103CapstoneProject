"RSO During BMT On Sunday. Need advice! Some Background:
Before Booking out to collect my A level results, I was on 3 day light duty due to a knee injury sustained during training. However, my knee injury is still persistent and I would like to report sick outside (RSO). I have to Book in on Sunday, but polyclinics are closed now & I’m not sure if GP clinics are certified medical practictioners and has the Authority to give MC to stay at home for me to recover. My commanders have not been helpful and only stated Govnt hospitals/Polyclinics & a general guide for RSO. i’m aware that i would have to stay at home and update my commanders on my movements. Can anyone advice me on certified practictioners (GP) to consult for RSO as my case isnt life threatening to be sent to A&E hospital, but rather I’m unfit for duty. Just super confused and helpless at this point.."

"My experience in NS as an Indian. Hey guys. Just wanted to throw this out here 

During my basic training I found that I had no trouble getting along with my squad mates, apart from the occasional jokes about my Indian accent, which I took in a good natured manner. 

Fast forward to unit life, and I seem to be having a bit of trouble. Don’t get me wrong I’m not super depressed or angry or some shit, just wanted to see what you guys think. 

One of my instructors keeps telling me “this is india not singapore hold the gun properly not like some Bollywood star” or “do you know why I wouldn’t send you to stand in a spot in the shade?” And just constantly belittles my race. 

A couple of guys in my squad also constantly mock my accent, not in the fun way my basic training friends used to. When I told them I was gonna do a comp engg degree after NS, their first comment was “why follow the stereotype”. That stung quite a bit. I’ve worked my ass off to get in to that course and they just think it’s some BS that every Indian does or wtv. They even make jokes like “oh does your dad work at a money changer / when you grow up you can start a scam call centre business”. 

Am I just overreacting? Like should I just stay calm and play along with these jokes as I’ve been doing so far? I feel like Singapore’s USP is that it’s a place with racial harmony etc. But from my experience so far it’s just that all the racism is swept under the carpet. Any advice? Thanks everyone!"

question about weird excuses. Hi guys I'm enlisting soon and I got 'excuse live ammunition and blanks'. If I'm excused blanks but not firearms then will I still have any contact with rifle? Will I just carry them around empty???
"Hi I'm a little bit confused. How different is Physical Training Phase (PTP) and Obese BMT? Okay so my BMI is 28.2 so I'm most likely gonna be PES BP (I haven't gotten it officially yet). Thing is, I got 65 points (meaning pass with incentive) for IPPT hence the IPPT calculator on CMPB website says ""If you are graded PES A or B1, you will be exempted from the 8-week Physical Training Phase."" 

IIRC, if one is PES BP he'll have to go for Obese BMT. After completing that they'll review his BMI and reclassify him into another PES grade. 

My question is that is Obese BMT the same as PTP? Or are they different? 

Are they held at two different times (Obese BMT at the start of NS and PTP at the end)? So if it as such, if I become PES A or B1 at the end of Obese BMT then I won't have to do PTP later on? 

I took my IPPT in school, in case this information is needed.

Thanks!"
"Dealing with wisdom toothache (until my surgery date comes) Hey yall, starting this week had encountered intense toothache pains in my lower right wisdom tooth. Have gone through the system and have gotten a surgery date 1 month from now.

Any tips on how to tahan until my surgery? So far I've been getting by with keeping cold water in my mouth near the affected area but I can't sleep at all due to the 1 pillow per bed thing and unfortunately for me, painkillers aren't working.

It's getting frustrating not being able to sleep properly"

I’m only ORDing at the same time as a few others in my unit, so my understanding is that it’s more of an OTOT thing that I have to schedule."
"Stuck in SCS coy for 3+ Months after OOC. Any advice? Hey there! I was from the 46/20 (grats on graduating guys!) batch of SCS cadets. I was posted here after completing BMT (from mono 42 SAR) and OOC’d due to an injury. Long story short, I have been stuck with my SCS coy since November and have yet to be posted out. I have tried talking to my Ops Spec, CWO, 2IC, OC and even S1 of my unit and all have given me the 🤷‍♂️ and told me there is nothing they can do but to wait. I was told my long term status is affecting my posting, but I need the status to protect myself. While I am not suffering here, the lack of purpose and overall draining of my energy has been depressing and I even developed symptoms of depression that I am currently seeking help for. For those wondering, I am currently on status till end March.

TL;DR: OOC SCS found term due to injury (on long term status), want to get posted out, tried talking to all possible channels to no avail, getting depressed about it, any advice?"
"Need advice on whether i should try to downpes with existing injury? Commando. Currently I am in CDO, and I am getting sick and tired of this combat unit. I suffered a lower back injury earlier in my airborne phase and was referred for MRI but i didnt go. I pushed on for awhile, but currently I feel that the environment is toxic, and we are doing things with no actual purpose, other than to feed the egos of our commanders and those who actually enjoy it. I’m losing my motivation, but a part of me still want to complete this journey. 

What I am worried about is my reservist. I do no see myself doing this again when I am in my 30s. So say I get to downpes, how will my reservist life be affected?

Edit: what i forgot to mention is that the next scheduled MRI is 1.5 months away, that makes it a little more difficult for me to decide"
"Local Medical Disruption Scheme. What are the requirements to get disrupted for medical school? Do you need to be of a minimum pes status, have experienced the sit test or things like that?

In addition, if let’s say you get have a medical condition that is likely to be aggravated towards the end of the BMT (eg maybe 3 weeks left), when is the best time to downpes so as to avoid having to recourse? In this context, the high keys have been passed. 

Thanks!!"

"Knee pain for 3 weeks showing no signs of recovering... My knee had been slightly injured before my field camp. Since we had to high kneel literally anywhere and everywhere it worsened the injury. Worst still we had our 8km road march after we came back from field camp and despite resting over the weekend and this Lunar New Year break my knee is still having issues. Basically, whenever I wake up or sit for a long time my knees would hurt a significant bit and become stiff, however when I run the pain and stiffness goes away. Am I actually injured or is it something else not putting my knee health in jeopardy? All opinions are welcomed and I hope to get some good advice before my 12 km road march!  


P.S. I didn't report sick because I wanted to complete my high keys and not have to retake it with people from other coys."
