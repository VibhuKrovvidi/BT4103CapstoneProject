Enlisting in tekong i felt like NS isn't really that bad ( Probably because i was a recruit and in a Wellfare company ) i did enjoy my BMT days more than my UNIT now. 

After Passing Out from BMT , i didn't really expect to be a Transport Operator and i feel lucky because hearing from my Fellow army friends , Most NSFs who are in Mono or any other combat unit would die to have this vocation.

Went to driving course but OOC at the Public Road Test because i failed my 4th attempt. i do not know about you all but probably most NSFs in MY OPINION probably sees driving course is easy af and arguably easier than other courses. i do agree with these people but because i OOC , i feel like a failure because even if i tried my best , i still failed miserably. ( i did try my very best to pass the final test) I really just feel like a failure because most people see TO as an easy vocation and to me failing such a course is a huge backlash to my mindset

Even sleeping at night is hard because of these thoughts and i feel i just disappointed my Sirs / Encik who clearly wanted me to pass. I know just sucking it up is the logical mindset but i just feel disappointed for failing. My unit probably sees my OOC as me being a Chao Keng.


So i would like to ask if anyone has any advices or has experienced in OOC before. How did you overcome it ?",72b420f4-6da1-11ea-ad4d-0e680b685b25,üò† Rant,1612863860.0
