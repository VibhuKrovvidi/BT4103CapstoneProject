For the mods, by having more credible posters, we can tune down on moderating too much, giving posters and readers more space and freedom.

2. You are lucky enough that you no need to clean the ceiling fan. I personally do not think theres much of a hazard cleaning the wall fan.

3. How difficult is it to open up the case of the fan and removing the blade to clean? If you really that afraid then just undo the case and use wet tissue lor.

4. Its important to keep your fans clean. The dust on the blade and case may trap virus or causes allergy to someone. To keep it clean reduce it, and also makes the wind cooler and more powerful.

We used to sit on the cabinet and slowly remove the casing before wiping the casing and the fan blades.


Honestly if it drops just use your hands to hold it as a precaution. The entire process is not that difficult.


You don't need to be trained to do this. Somethings can be figured out via trial and error. And even if you break it, hey it belongs to the army. At most you write a statement. Think of it as a free lesson to learn how to clean a fan so that when your future spouse asks for  your help, you won't give her the ''i m not fan-cleaning trained'' reaction.

How long has this ""farmed like a dog"" lasted, 3 months +, and developing symptoms of what?  Have some compassion to those assigned to doing stores after BMT, I work with various levels. Storemen very strong bonds, they work together and rest together.

Procedural wise,  Generally the headcount of the Company is as specified by the Orbat, how many of various staff at what level, adding one personal requires sign off at various levels, aka lots of paperwork.

Trainees come in as a Batch, distributed and held at the various levels (Company)  
End of Course, results submitted, used to be CPC, and a list of Postings is Generated to the Trainees.  
And they goes to their way, OCS for the top few, Further courses for those vocations, back to Unit for the rest that passed.

OOC, case by case basis, as there are mant reason for OOC, most common is injuries. Some Units (especially Mono-intakes) don't want the injured personal back, as it reduces there effective Headcount.

For SCS, Known of cases OOCs, assuming they are Fit For Instructions, held back to the next run of the similar course.  Those whom are unable to join the next batch, luck of the draw.

Differs from batch to batch, but combat fit usually almost definitely disrupts (A, B1, B2). In fact PES C also usually disrupts.

Best time to downpes is after BMT. 100% make sure you have already finished the course, turned private before pursuing downpes. 
If you have already passed 2 out of 3 of BTP, IPPT and Field Camp, you have technically already passed BMT unless your OC wants to OOC you. (Though most will not because it looks bad to have a low passing rate for a company).",1613407852.0,lji9uk

During NSF, you will need to take minimally once during your BMT, before end of first year and before you ORD. These three IPPTs are the minimum attempts you need to take if you are lucky to score well at each of the attempt. My NSF unit used to have a habit to conduct IPPT once a week.

After ORD, you will need to take once every birthday window (Opens on your birthday and closes on 1 day before your next birthday) until you are 40 years old for WOSE, 45 years old for Officers or until you fall under MINDEF Reserve (MR).

If you are downpes permanently to PES B3 and below (exclude C1), you don't have to take IPPT.

It's never easy driving rusty decades-old oversized vehicles on the road, more so without a lot of experience with normal class 3 vehicles. Back in the day when there were 8 attempts, a lot of people used to pass on 6th~8th try. They still ended up as good drivers and got their 4K.

Secondly, don't think that you're a failure just because you've had a bad start in this ""easy"" (it may not be as easy as you expect) vocation. Sure, not being able to pass in 4 tries does mean we'll need to pay more attention to you, but driving is a lifelong skill in which a vast majority of people improve with experience. It just means you'll need more experience, hopefully you're able to recourse.

Lastly, don't think about how others view you. It's good that you wanted to pass for your sirs/encik but don't worry too much about it, they've seen a lot of OOCs. They can tell who really wanted to pass, and who just wanted to chao keng.
