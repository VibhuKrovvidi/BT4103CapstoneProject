Quote: MINDEF Services > Non-ICT IPPT/RT > FAQ > Medical Excuse and Examination  Q4 I have reached 35 years old and was informed that I need to do an ""IPPT-FFI"". What is an ""IPPT-FFI""? ""IPPT-FFI"" was the term used to refer to the compulsory medical examination done for all IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 and above. The ""IPPT-FFI"" has been incorporated into the revised SAF Health Screening Programme which came into effect on 30 May 2011. There is no need to do a separate ""IPPT-FFI"" if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening Programme for that year.  All IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 years and above are required to complete the SAF Health Screening Programme every year before attempting IPPT. The aim of this medical screening is to detect any medical conditions which may make you unsuitable for the IPPT. You will not be allowed to take the IPPT if you are 35 years old and above and have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements for the year.  The SAF Health Screening Programme review will be initiated by your NS unit administrator when your IPPT window (birthday window) is open. You will be issued with a certificate after completion of your SAF health Screening Programme requirements. The certificate is valid until 30 day after your birthday. For example, if you are 35 years old, the certificate will be valid until (and including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday.",Raider04 wrote: System has changed. No longer have Phase 1 and 2.

Please refer to the following: https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...idelines-rt/rt Quote: In the event that D is more than 20, it will be capped at 20. You will not have to take RT but must attempt at least 1 IPPT (i.e. Non-ICT IPPT or ICT IPPT) in your IPPT Window. IPPT is also conducted on the 8th, 14th and 20th RT sessions (also known as RT IPPT). But if there are less than 8 RT sessions, RT IPPT will be held on the last session. Hence, the correct answer is :In window 16/17, I only have to attend 7 RT sessions, and the 7th session will be my RT-IPPT. I will not be a defaulter in the following window.","almondNeo wrote: Let me emphasis, you attempted 13 IPPT in window 15/16 and failed and you're required to attend 7 RT in window 16/17. In window 16/17, the criteria to complete RT, as mentioned by Calander also, is the completion of the sessions required PLUS 1 attempt of IPPT.  Given that you'll only require 7 sessions of RT, there won't be any 8th sessions for you hence you won't be able to book your IPPT. Hence, you'll be deemed as IPPT defaulter in window 16/17 and congrats, 20 sessions of RT is waiting in window 17/18."

However, conditions to complete RT -  You must attend all required sessions of RT with at least 1 RT IPPT attempt, all within your current window. You can also fulfil your RT requirements earlier by passing an In-Camp Training (ICT) IPPT or either of your first 2 RT IPPT sessions.   The 1st RT-IPPT will be on the 8th.   Bottomline... is there any reason which u want to challenge the system which has been tweaked from 9mths to 12mths to complete IPT, with only a need to complete 10sessions instead of (10+8) , plus all IPT sessions has a 1/2 svc pay?  You may like to feedback to your constituency's MP, CMPB or Mindef if this revised system is still an issue to you.  Pls recognise the effort that Mindef has implemented.

How can I opt for IPT-IPPT if I am confident enough to clear my PPT level without going through all 10 sessions? Do I book for IPPT or book for IPT session?  2. If I were to attain the required points for my PPT level in one station (e.g. Push Up) but I fail to gain any points (zero) in Sit Up and 2.4, will it still count as early completion?  Thanks for answering!"

448,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",terrykorkor,"I think, maybe people might have heard of some flaw in the RT system in the past. For the 1st year, you will just fail your ippt at the last day of your current 1st year window, and you will be asked to do RT on the second year window while your second year IPPT window opens. However, after you completed your RT session in the 2nd year, your 2nd year IPPT window is automatically cleared too. Effectively, you will only need to do RT every 2 years. I think laojiao might know what I am talking about here in the early days. If you can pass your IPPT easily, then this is probably not a topic for you. There are even ways to calculate the minimum amount of times you need to go to FCC (which includes risking and the amount of time you can get disciplinary warning from NS + the penalty cost of it). But I will not discuss this here. However, NS.sg update their system 1-2 years ago and required soldiers to attend ippt asap or else face disciplinary action for that year (in term of window). You will need to clear ippt (as pass status, or through completion of ipt/rt) for every window. So, I believe, the patch up the loophole. Actually, I think going for RT/IPT is good. At least a few days of exercise is the healthy choice isn't it.","Calander wrote: is all 1 year.. never ever a 2 years cycle.  so to say, if in Year 2 u still cannot complete ""20-D"" RT sessions, in Year 3 u will need to do ""20-D"" again.

714,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",kaisoz,"First time will be warning. When they charge you first time, can be at CMPB, or at your unit camp, or during ICT if there is an upcoming ICT. So far, I have never heard of people kenna first charge and fined. But kenna fine is the worst case scenario for first time charge. Unless you really go and shoot back at them gaolat gaolat. If you do that, you will confirm hong gan gao gao. If you get called to CMPB, its also not confirmed that you definitely will get fined. I went CMPB before to answer charge, no fine. But basically, your fate is in the hands of the officer-in-charge. If you show guai lan face and talk back, then of course kena fine or worse is a possibility. Now, after clearing the first charge, its up to you liao. If you bochup again the next year or two, of course, be prepared to face charge again and kenna fined again. If you don't want to give $ to SAF, then you must plan your RT now. If you are totally CMI case, confirm cannot pass on the 8th or 14th RT session, that means you have to go for the full 20 RT sessions. Well, actually its 17 RT and 3 RT-IPPT (8th,14th,20th). Lets say you go for the full 20 sessions. If you go once every weekend, you clear your IPPT liabilities in 20 weeks. If you can squeeze out 1 weekday, then you clear in 10 weeks. If you are getting up there in age, and very long never do exercise, never even go kick football or play bball, then I sincerely advise you to do some light workouts at home, since right now, you may not be able to book RT sessions, until you finish the charge process. Just do like 5-10 pumping. Or wake up on weekend, do like 10 minute jogging before you jiak breakfast. This is to slowly work your body into some physical shape. Thus, you reduce the risk of injury. If you suddenly do RT exercise, can get injured de. Moi tio injury during RT. Heng, I had enough time to recover, before continuing RT and passing on the 14th RT-IPPT. Ownself should ownself know own body. So take care always, think safety always. Yes, starting the RT process is super duper sian and marhuan, and really throws a kink into your schedule. Everyone knows. The only hard part is clearing your work schedule enough to start. Once you start, its very easy liao. You basically can just show face at RT, go through the motions can liao. If you want to quickly pass and avoid going more RT sessions, then of course you will have to put in effort. After you clear RT, can consider the IPT process, since its much shorter, only 10 sessions niah. RT or IPT, you still get paid. So it helps cover public transport (plus makan) totally or partially helps cover fuel costs if taking motorbike or car. Haiz, what to do? Born in SG ish like that de. NS for sinkies, jobs for FTs. Good luck on your charge.","busybeeman wrote: Hello bros,  So I failed my IPPT last year and did not go for the 19 RT sessions. My closing window is next month.

IPPT may be cancelled and attendance will not be counted. Whereas IPT at FCCs will continue.  so...

MO will make the decision as to how many months u shall be excused from IPPT. There is a policy that if the excused is more than a certain period of month, you will then be excused from clearing the IPPT window. However, for your case is quite vague but i believe it can be excused. 2 - ICT in june... if your MO gives the excuse of IPPT that your ICT is during this period, u are not allowed to take part in the IPPT. basically when u meet your camp's MO, do check with your S1 or S8 / NSC / Persnode about your IPPT window. Or you can request NS hotline to inform your unit to give u a callback. this should help in your queries.","Ggdotcomzzz wrote: Hi all  My window closes at the end of June 2019 and I am currently in my RT window.

Another best reason to name is gym doesn't give you any incentives if u are to qualify for incentives, but IPT-IPPT has.","robthebin wrote: Hello, I failed my IPPT at SAFRA last weekend because I stepped off the treadmill like an idiot.

As you had mentioned, your MO will only accept letter from specialist which you will have that on 18 Feb itself. Given your IPPT is in June, I do not understand what kind of answers you are trying to get here.  So as to answer to your question directly, if your specialist supports you to be exempted from IPPT, you will most likely be exempted for your IPPT in June.

Based on the latest update we have received, the system will reflect the booking for March 2020 by end of today.  We would like to suggest you to try to book for your RT session again tomorrow to book for March 2020 slots.  Should you require further assistance, please contact us at 1800 3676767, or +(65) 6567 6767 if you are calling from overseas.

1865,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",ragegoh,"This I can relate. I was studying part time and holding a full time job. Took an engineering degree which involves lab sessions in weekdays. 4 lessons a week not including the assignments and projects. The only time I can rest properly is 2 days. I usually clear the sessions during semesters break. And sometimes, work simply doesn’t allow me to leave early. I have to reach FCC by 6:45pm latest maybe 7pm? If I’m lucky they will let me in pro.  However this year is different. I can clear the window in one month. I started in Feb with a 3 months buffer but sessions were either full or cancelled. To be honest I’m worried about the covid evolving situation at that time. But I still have to do my best to clear as many sessions as possible. The situation is as such the Trainers actually called us one by one to notify us of the cancellation. Then all my sessions got cancelled by NS portal. I rebooked. Then CB came. Then Mindef waived my window. My new window has just started. And as days pass by, my window is getting shorter. So yes, it is our responsibility to clear the window WITHIN the one year period.  Just like years ago, we have to clear 10sessions IPT and then 3 months for 8 RT. Our own responsibility is to clear the required sessions within the stipulated time frame.",NIL

As a punishment for defaulting IPPT, it also doesn't seem to be a good deterrent, compared to heavy fines. Turning up for RT also nets the offender half-day NS pay for each session anyway.

2531,"SAF IPPT, IPT & RT Questions...",anyhowsaysay,"SINGAPORE - Instead of attending remedial or voluntary preparatory training for failing their individual physical proficiency test (IPPT), operationally ready national servicemen (NSmen) will from April 1, 2021, need to complete a new 10-session NS Fitness Improvement Training (FIT) programme.  The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) announced this on Monday (Mar 15) as it unveiled plans for NS FIT to be available at 45 locations islandwide. There are currently 13 sites where NSmen can undergo training.  Under the new programme, NSmen will be able to choose from at least six different NS FIT training activities to fulfil the required 10 sessions.  They can register for sessions through the ns.sg portal from March 25.  Currently, those unable to pass IPPT can opt for 10 voluntary IPPT preparatory training (IPT) sessions, or participate in up to 20 remedial training (RT) sessions.  Brigadier-General Kenneth Liow, director of National Service Affairs, said NS FIT would streamline this ""complicated"" system of annual fitness requirements into one common programme  Each NS FIT session, lasting approximately 60 to 75 minutes, can be easily fit into NSmen's busy schedules, he added.  ""The vast majority of our NSmen meet their fitness requirements,"" said BG Liow. ""NS FIT is aimed at trying to promote a more healthy and active lifestyle.""  The programme is one of the NS review committee's initiatives and also a collaboration between the SAF, Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Sport Singapore (SportSG).  The three organisations had in 2017 signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote fitness and health among NSmen.  On top of existing training locations at parks, Safra gyms and Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs) within army camps, NSmen can choose to undergo NS FIT at an additional three upcoming gym sites under ActiveSG - the national movement for sport - and 29 locations under HPB's Quick HIIT (high intensity interval training) banner.  The Quick HIIT programme, started in 2018 as a first initiative under the MOU, is conducted seven days a week at malls, community spaces and SportSG facilities.  It is open to the general public and features short bursts of high-intensity exercises that build strength, endurance and aerobic fitness over time.  This is similar to metabolic circuit sessions conducted at FCCs, which also offer activities focused on aerobic threshold, weight loss, sports and IPPT-specific exercises.  Sessions at the Safra gyms are customised based on individual needs, and should an NSman decide to attend NS FIT at one, he will have to compete all 10 sessions at either of the six dedicated FIT @ Safra gyms.  The programme at the upcoming ActiveSG gym sites - in Bedok, Jurong East and Tampines - will be confirmed later.  The 10 sessions include one IPPT attempt, to be taken at the NSman's choosing. If he passes the test before the 10 sessions, he will not need to fulfil the remainder.  NS FIT was trialled from 2018 to 2019 with about 250 NSmen, including a brigade commanded by Colonel (NS) Michael Hua, 49.  He said: ""The feedback we got from the guys from the ground was (that) it gives them flexibility, and offers convenience. More importantly, it allows them to integrate fitness into their lifestyles.""  NSmen's friends and family can also join them in their Quick HIIT sessions by booking a slot using HPB's Healthy 365 mobile app.  Home Team's NSmen will also adopt NS FIT from June onwards. They will be able to undergo FIT sessions at Home Team premises, HomeTeamNS Clubhouses and ActiveSG gyms.  https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-fit-programme",NIL
