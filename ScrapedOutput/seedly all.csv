Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4d ago,Purchased,"I was kind of hesitant to sign up for circles life at first as I saw many comments online about bad customer service, poor network and all that. But their cny promo was too good to pass up so I thought just try la. After all if it really was that bad, I can just port out again. I am writing this review to tell those naysayers YOU WERE WRONG. Customer service is clearly next level, I dropped them a dm close to 1am enquiring about how to check my upcoming bill and kai instantly replied me. Not a bot, a real person who sent me helpful screenshots to guide me. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"Having been with circles life since 2018, I can safely say they really are one of the better telcos out there. Their customer service is prompt and efficient. I've seen improvements in their network so it shows they really listen! The app is also one of the best I've used in a long time. An incredible experience that everyone should try for themselves."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service] friendly customer service team that replies even late at night, only wish that they have hotline so i can thank them over the phone personally"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Customer service team is courteous and really know their stuff. They helped clarify that I wouldn't be getting a free tablet with my Data Only subscription, which was a bit of a bummer but it makes sense. Still might get a tablet later for my parents. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"I am writing this as i intend to switch to another telco. Reason being Circles network is really poor. I have been with Circles for some time, the benefits are really generous and customer service is prompt and friendly. But network is core when it comes to selecting a quality telco. Probably M1 network has been deteriorating and Circles that leech onto M1 network is implicated. Thus, its users indirectly affected."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Really friendly agents, especially on IG. Kai was easy to talk to and answered all my queries promptly. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,Will never ever recommend this lousy service to anyone!
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,"Porting over my number was super easy. And you can never run out of or worry about data with Circles. Mobile app has really good UI, I never encountered any issues with buying add-ons or checking my bills. Top-notch customer service as well. If you're looking to port over from another telco, I highly recommend circles"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,"As a long time customer and someone who works on the go a lot, circles really does a great job at delivering a powerful and portable product. I also really enjoy their customer service. Even when I'm busy and forget to reply, an agent always comes to follow-up on my case. Highly recommend circles to everyone."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,Great Customer Service and fast Network to stream movies. The User friendly Mobile app makes it easy to navigate the add-ons as well. Highly recommend using Circles ☺️
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,"I was a happy customer with Circle LIfe SIM only prepaid plan for past years with 2 lines. Initially the data was at 50GB and later increased to 100GB per month.  However with NO notice, CIrcle Life suddenly reduced both lines to 20GB in the middle of the subscription month and causing both lines to go dead (as it exceeded 20GB usage). No reason was given. Bills were paid every month.  It was extremely disappointing and NO response from circle life for 3 days (though has been receiving emails daily that they will respond within 24hrs).  Bad experience and totally unprofessional."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 05 Feb 2021,Purchased,"Have been using Circles for years now, and i have nothing bad to say.  Exceptional customer service. I always have so much data, i don't even use my wifi at home anymore! Best thing is you can also use your hotspot when you are working outside as well - super convenient. Marketing is always top notch too."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 01 Feb 2021,None,"[Customer Service] Before I purchase the Sim + phone package, I reached out to the customer service to ask if it is possible for me to request for a separate earlier Sim card delivery, as I understand that phone delivery will take a while due to stock availability.  After I have paid for the phone, I then followed the instruction to try to request for the earlier delivery, but there was no option to do so. I reached out to the customer service again and now they are telling me that it cannot be done after ""talking to their team"".  I replied to the email with the copied text from the first customer service guy showing that I was promised it can be done, and requested for their assistance for this. This was last Friday evening, till now I am having radio silence from the customer service. So far the customer service experience has been frustrating as there was a lot of back and forth without anything being solved."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 30 Jan 2021,Purchased,"TLDR: lies upon lies by customer service, porting is a terrible experience and I have not been ported yet even. excuses of ASAP / 24h / 24-48h given, not sure if they have a concept of time. I’m utterly baffled at the customer service and how ‘ease of porting’ is promoted by this company. After 4 unsuccessful attempts, I contacted their Customer Service Chat. I contacted 2 agents asking when I will be receiving the call. Both told me they raised it to be ‘ASAP’. 3. lies upon lies provided by their customer service (ASAP, 24h, 48h)"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 20 Jan 2021,Purchased,"Their service used to be a lot better when they first started! I even recommended my mum and my friends to join CL. Fast forward 2 to 3 years and their service experience are no longer what it used to be! Their so-called Happiness Experts are slow to respond and are generally unhelpful! When they do respond, they ignore responding to your queries with almost standard replies and the terse, insincerity that lacks the warmth and empathy! Lethargic! I requested them to give my mum (she is 93 years old and is quite smartphone savvy) the same promo they gave me but they said 'no'! They gave her a 3-month unlimited data freebie but I told them that my mum has more than enough data. It took 2 attempts (and almost 2 weeks of clunky email communication) before they finally helped my mum! When you have a problem and need to speak to someone on the phone, you are not likely to succeed! I am a very disappointed user!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 20 Jan 2021,None,"[Billing & Customer Service] The concept of a no contract Combo Plan was really intriguing but the execution and communication of this unorthodox billing method could have been clearer. For example, I don't understand why even as I am paying for my phone via installments the entire amount is blocked off from my credit card? It's identical to having selected the upfront option with the exception that it's deductible every month. This however is a small gripe that I can live with as the agents who assisted me were patient enough to explain the process. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 19 Jan 2021,None,"Generally, the service and network are OK considering the price. I cannot use rate it one star because of one customer support (but still). Still an active customer for a very long time. Changing to 1 star after contacting Customer Support"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Jan 2021,Purchased,"[Customer Service] If I were to say only one thing about Circles, it would be about their awesome customer service. In the 2+ years I have been with them, I've contacted them with queries about everything from billing to promotions and every single time they've responded promptly with the utmost professionalism I have not seen in other businesses for a long time.  Sure, more can be done for loyal customers as I've been denied access to certain promos specifically for new customers before but I also see that they have launched similar features for their customers. Now I get monthly rewards from their quest update and they recently upgraded my waiver so that I enjoy $18 forever. I think any other telco would be hard pressed to do that since such a move will surely impact their revenue but Circles has always been an unconventional brand that never played by the rules since the very start. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 07 Jan 2021,Purchased,I got the $5 plan for my dad to use and it was a little frustrating at first as I couldn't find the plan on their website. I reached out to customer service for help and they immediately redirected me to the page to sign up. It has been smooth sailing ever since. Number was transferred without an issue and I downloaded the app for him so I can monitor his usage in case he calls his kakis too much. Would be nice if I could manage multiple plans from one phone but otherwise I think their $5 plan works for seniors!
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 06 Jan 2021,Purchased,[Customer Service] I really cannot tahan some of the customer service from other telcos but with circles they managed to solve a billing issue with a full refund in the span of 2 hours. Some other bloody telco 2 hours also cannot get on the phone with them...

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Dec 2020,None,"The app had a bug and did not allow me to do the online porting. I reached out to the customer service but they kept asking me to do it on the app. Passed me to several different people to try to have it resolved. In the end they agreed to do manual porting, but gave me the wrong form to fill. I highlighted this but they said it’s ok. Then the next day a new person tell me that it’s not ok.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 25 Dec 2020,Purchased,"Worst telco service i have experienced so far. Please stay away. on the 3rd month of subscription, circle life wrongly charged me a small amount and I also experienced a week service disruption. after contacting support many times, they agreed to refund me the wrongly charged amount, and I terminated the service due to the poor experience. I tried to follow up in mid-Dec on the agreed refund, and keep getting replies they are not going to refund me because 1. the charges are already recorded in advance and 2. I have terminated the service so for goodness sake circle life help your customer understand your logic here?? Due to your own fault, you are not refunding leaving customers the wrongly charged amount??"

To be honest, I just have to key in my personal particulars and that’s it. It was really fast. Porting over to Circles.Life is my best decision ever."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 19 Dec 2020,None,"[Customer Service] The worst customer service ever, even on the chat the person (Rupert) takes way too long to reply, and their billing system is so weird they bill the phone and the data plan separately.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 25 Nov 2020,Purchased,An unfortunate horrible customer service experience at all the stage of the process. I wouldn’t recommend the company to anyone.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 22 Nov 2020,Purchased,"Switched over from M1 because it costs 40% lesser, for even more benefits! The switch saved me $20 every month. However, they will charge $0.05 for any incoming SMS, which is ridiculous to me because I get spam SMSes and/or delivery SMS/MMS quite often. The one thing that stands out is about their super fast customer service. Pretty much the same network and service for even less money!"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 12 Nov 2020,None,"For a Telco that aspires to be a ""breath of fresh air"" to our local Telco scene, it had been an utterly disappointing experience, and this will probably be the end of my relationship with Circles.Life. I had been a customer with Circles.Life for more than a year, and the network coverage had been getting worse for some reason.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Nov 2020,None,"[Customer Service] Spend money to join waitlist to preorder iPhone 12 pro max is a brain less system I had seen ever. Go and ask the customer service in messenger before the pre order date keep told me just wait for the email which will send to customer when preorder is ready. Wait for 10 minutes from the beginning of the preorder, no emailed have been sent to us. Where is the promised? customer service? Where is the email to show the procedure to pre order who had joined the waitlist? Brianless system. Ask in the messenger for help on 9.08pm but wait until 1am get the first reply? What a good service. Marked up the phone by 100dollar said due to the lack of product have to use this 100 dollar to secure the phone? It’s fine but still have to wait for 1 month? Lmao. Apart from that, what is the purpose to have a join waitlist system? Ask us to paid but those who paid for it cannot get the phone earlier than who didn’t pay the money to join the waitlist? Well done Circles.Life. Bravo. To be proud of your team. Brain less."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Nov 2020,Purchased,"I can see myself leaving CL, especially as price and service offerings becomes more competitive. Felt bad leaving a service that gave me the best CS experience out of all other service providers. But the iPhone 12 waitlist experience and poor signal strength making me miss calls/SMS/internet even when I'm at home is swaying me to other service providers especially when many WFH and requires a reliable way to contact others and be contacted. Albeit it comes with a year worth of phone insurance and $200 bill credit. Probably no one ever needs a phone insurance plan if you have a case and screen protector on and any other defects will be covered by Apple's 1 year warranty. $200 bill credit after the $100 price increment of the iPhone 12 as compared to the Apple store, makes up to $100 worth of bill credit, which is easily offset if you move from CL's $28 base plan to other service provider such as $20 GOMO plan and save $8/mth that has the same base data (40GB if you sign-up during promotion), more call time, SMS and on SingTel's network which has the highest coverage in SG. [Customer Service] Great CS support throughout my 2-3 years with CL. CSO can always give you a code if you felt that you've missed out on a certain ongoing deal that existing customers can't enjoy. They listened to your feedback and improve on their service, this is obvious when you see some of your feedback affected their plan and promotional offerings. Very customizable, easy to use and gives full control to activate/deactivate add-on services in a few taps. There's some fun feature such as daily polls that allows you to win prizes and missions that will increase your data. Some subtle ads that are disguised as exclusive benefits for CL users to enjoy, however, it's not those annoying ""in your face"" ads and it could be useful if you require those services."

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 19 Sep 2020,Purchased,"Indoor coverage is a bit poorer compare to the others. But among the digital telco, Circles.Life is the only one provide VoLTE service, this is their advantage. [Customer Service] Super fast and responsive customer service. I could say their customer service is one of the best among all the telco. They are consistent and easy to reach. They deliver their promise most of the time. Too many information in the app makes the app seems messy. Can we log in the service portal by browser? What I know is cannot. If I were right, it's not so user-friendly. Hopefully the layout in the app could be improved, and hope they can implement a web portal allow us to log in by browser too. I couldn't say they offer the best value since they are other competitors offer even better choices. But they are definitely worth the value with their customer service quality. Personally, I don't like this kind of gimmick since it could lead to ""double standard"" sometime."

I honestly do not know what happens behind the scenes since its the Covid period and perhaps its a mess as well for them. But from the customer's side, it really was an unpleasant last experience with them."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 20 Apr 2020,None,I applaud your efforts to become the fasting growing telco in Singapore. This is not easy because you are up against established & wealthy competitors like Singtel. But you did well by having niche promotions to attract new customers.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 16 Apr 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service]  Reviewing here because no one at Circles Life can't be bothered about an ""old"" customer or understand the issues I have raised.  I was one of the earliest customers when they started off, 3 years I believe? They did a good job from being the first mover and great customer service to the ease of use of app (still is the leading one). As of late last year, I noticed that when I was happily paying $30 (including $2 free incoming) monthly which I was happy to do that, but the news of new customers that came onboard was only paying $18 per month for the same package did put me off a fair bit. Guess ""first-movers"" shouldn't be rewarded? I must be fair that from early this year till now, though they gave me a 3 month discount of $10 (when other new customers are on $18 forever?), I have not heard from them after much discussions via email (which proves to be really bad) with customer service officers not understanding myself, or email bots used? The promise was to revert after 3 months, but... maybe because of the COVID-19 situation, they have been quite busy."

I love it when they adopt the live-chat session as well as the recorded conversation so that neither one can deny whatever that is being said.

However, CirclesLife still has much better user experience using the app, although their customer service has dropped significantly since the beginning. Overall 3/5. I believe CirclesLife leases bandwidth from M1, which has fairly comprehensive coverage. I didn't experience any problems with them, even when I went back for reservice in Sungei Gedong. [Customer Service] 2/5 When I first switched from Starhub, CirclesLife's customer service was incredible. Responses from their CSOs on the app's messaging platform was quick, helpful, and extremely efficient. Compared to Starhub's stupid hotline where they put you on hold for an hour, CirclesLife really blew the competition away. We really have to thank CirclesLife for disrupting the uncompetitive telco market with how they re-conceived mobile service provision. Unfortunately, that was 2 years ago. More recently, their customer service has truly been dismal. Conversations with their CSOs on the app would drop halfway and they would suddenly pair you with a new CSO, and you had to explain your problem all over again. This was incredibly frustrating and on one occasion I was dropped and re-paired a total of 11 times before I gave up. I never got my issue resolved.  I was truly turned off by the lousy customer service that dropped tremendously in standard compared to 2 years ago. Coupled with the better value for money in other plans, it was difficult for me not to switch."

My number was originally not under my own name, so using GOMO or Giga, I had to manually do the number transfer. Moreover, I called Starhub and they said I had to go down to the shop personally with the account holder, pay a $20 transfer. Circles.Life had none of these, they simply had me key in the account holder's IC number, sign, and did the rest for me. Voila. App is clean, super easy to use.

So at this point of moment where I have 1 outstanding amount which wasn’t paid , so I decided to look for the happiness expert ( customer service) and enquire about is it possible that I made the payment on this date so and so . So they went on did their checking , they said alright sure can . So I did double confirm with them that I will pay on this certain date and my line won’t get cut off right ? , they said no as long as I pay on the date as I promised because it will really affect my school schedule . So Guess what , exactly on that night my line got cut off . So I was extremely pissed about it I went to look for their happiness expert again (customer service) and asked what’s going on , so they said rest assured they will get it back reconnected . Which I have to wait 2 whole days . So alright it’s their first I completely let bygones be bygones. Then when a year after the same thing happened. Exactly the same thing happened. This is the reason why I’m giving this a bad one . To me their only main word will be rest assured and the fact you can rest assured because you’ll be chasing them to reconnect your line like crazy .

They will add another repeater in that area. The other time was, during my reservist period. My second phone was still using the whole 2G network under Singtel, before they announced eliminating the network entirely to move towards 3G baseline network. So I asked them if they give another SIM card under the same line, and they said it's possible!  All your mobile plan are controlled inside an app by theirs. So you can mix-and-match anytime to change and suit your needs. Likewise, if you are planning to go JB, just turn on your data roaming on the app. They are activated a few minutes later! No more asking for roaming services via some website and wait for weeks to process. They now have a quiz section, that if you answered by the majority you get extra data as well! Gone the times you have to struggle, and think of how much data limit you have to plan out for this week, just so you have enough for the remaining days. Going green, the monthly bill payment are stored in the app, no more fussy monthly bill posted to you.

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Aug 2019,None,The best telco in Singapore. Service is fast and excellent. All members of my family has switch to Circle.Life
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Aug 2019,None,"Quite a smooth and direct process in application, and the plans are attractive too. Had some difficulties with the bill breakdown and misunderstanding of charges but customer service (chat service) was very prompt to resolve the issue. Service officer was polite and knowledgeable in offering solutions, which then changed my intention from termination to continuing my service with Circles. I had plenty of questions towards the fees and policies but he could explain each part in clear details + examples. So kudos in that, didn't have to get confused further. Hopefully Circles continue to keep up with their quick customer service and valuable plans. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Aug 2019,None,Circles is good because they build a community where people can share (earn data through referrals) and interact (polls and events). They value their customers. One suggestion I would make though is to make the price more appealing as competitors are now offering more with a cheaper price. 
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Aug 2019,None,"Love circles life telco! Honestly is the best, as u can customise all you want in your line. They will always check with you about their services and how to improve them by giving its users surveys. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 17 Aug 2019,None,"I've been with Circles Life since they first came to Singapore. And I've never had an issue with them. Their customer service is not only easily reachable via their chat, they are very helpful and do their best to help you in any way possible. I've recommended them to a number of people who are now paying half of what they used to pay with their previous telcos and are currently enjoying more freedom and benefits with Circles Life's customizable and affordable plans. Looking forward to many more years with Circles Life. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 17 Aug 2019,None,"I was a bit worried initially when I ported over to Circles Life because Circles Life seemed ""cheap"" in comparison to major players like Singtel and Starhub, but the data connectivity and amazing customer service only made me regret why I did not make the switch earlier. - User friendly and easy application process - 24/7 customer service team that is contactable via live chat or email anytime"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 17 Aug 2019,None,"I was initially a little apprehensive as Circles life did not have a physical store. Despite that, their online services were top notch. For instance, I was constantly updated on the delivery status of my SIM card via sms. Even when they were unable to locate my actual address, they tried contacting me. On top of that, their online messaging system was efficient and their staff readily made themselves available in case I needed help. Prices are excellent and reasonable with freebies such as unlimited data dangling from time to time. I also like how instructions were concise and lengthy terms and conditions were minimised. Despite not being tied down to a contract, I think I’d stay with Circleslife  for quite some time."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 17 Aug 2019,None,"The sign up process was fuss-free and immediate. Having received the sim card within days was amazing. No more having to queue extremely long hours just for a new phone/sim card. The signal is also way better than my previous telco, leaving me with no complaints at all. They’re also generous with giveaways and discounts and I see their efforts in engaging with customers which is really commendable in an industry which just asks you to sign up for their plans. Good job Circles! 👍🏼"
Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,"I was an early adopter of $0/mth Flexi-Plan in June 2018. This plan has 1GB data, 30 minutes talktime, 10 SMS, free caller ID. Though no overseas roaming service available. Those who are frequent travellers would need to take note.  Signing up on their website was quite simple. Just create a new Circlelife account with personal particulars, choose $0/mth Flexi Plan, upload my digital copy of NRIC and lastly fill in a Credit Card number. Delivery of SIM card by courier cost $6, there was no self-collection site.  Also, the app has a online Live Chat function with their customer serivce staff when I have an enquiry. The Live Chat does not respond immediately when activated, there will still be some minutes of waiting time before someone respond to my enquiry.  I have already used this Flexi-Plan on my spare phone for more than 12 months and Circlelife is still continuing this $0/mth plan with no changes in plan price yet. According to the Circlelife's customer service staff on livechat, as long I have usage on this line, either data or talktime in the last 3 months, this line will not be suspended or terminated. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 16 Aug 2019,None,Circles life is handsdown the best telco and has great customer service that beats any other telco. No way any other telco can compete with providing pro customer plans as well as prompt customer service

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,"Application was seamless, really impressed with their customer service who answered my queries with clear explanation and excellent interpersonal skills. Really happy with the data bonuses every now and then and that I saved quite a bit as compared to when I was still in binding ""slave contract"" with the previous telco 😉"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 16 Aug 2019,None,Is a great tele company. Especially the customer service team giving a excellent service. They reply fast and polite and trying their best to slove the problem  u facing. 
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,"Circles.Life has an easy application process just by doing it online. It is fuss-free, just taking a few minutes to fill up my particulars, make payment and viola, their staff processes the application within a few days and got back to me on the delivery of my SIM card. They have excellent customer service, even through the Facebook Messenger channel which I prefer since I’m busy working during the office hours and couldn’t really make a call. Even though there was a hiccup with the payment for registration initially causing a double charge to my card, the staff handled it situation well and were quick to process a refund for me and provide me with regular updates for the refund. Amazing telco with the customer in mind!"

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,Service has been great so far.

That was superb only thing was that new customers seemed to be getting better deals etc.. which felt bad, but then again we would get more data and freebies etc... (for me it was about price, as never manage to fulfil data caps) "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,circles is reasonably reliable and offers competitive pricing for its services. the one downside is that there is no hotline to call when you feel like screaming at someone. great way to train your capacity for patience. 8/10.
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"I signed on with Circles 2 years back and I have been very pleased with their services since and it is definitely value for money for the amount of data I get. The app's UX/UI design is great, love it!  I also love that there are options to boost your data by their partnership programs such as linking your EZLINK to the app. Something I recommend to my friends looking to switch telcos. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Initially, when Circles came into the market, I was rather skeptical. I was on M1 then, and was rather pleased with their services compared to the other 2 Telcos stated. Didn't think or moving over to them at the time, that's until my workplace sent out an email stating that they have a CIS package.  After a month using their services, I was pretty much sold to them. Their online chat made it easy to seek clarifications and doubts, and their turnaround time is way better than the 3 other Telcos. I have had to wait for more than 15 mins the least before I manage to get someone on the line,  and that is before I have to go through the frustrating process of listening to the teleprompter. "

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Circles.Life has brought value to us customers as the previous telcos like singtel, StarHub & m1 overlooked. Circles.Life was the genesis of a telco that required no contracts. It allowed us consumers to “decide” the amount of data we consume. They come up with Creative ideas on how to retain us customers by issuing loyal customers extra data’s for the month. Which is a we win situation as data in the current era is considered a necessity for us millennials we consume tons of data. They are thoughtful as they came up with plans that provide consumers “unlimited data” at a price of $20 which is really valued as the anchor was over a $100 ~ $200 per month for the other telcos. Personally I for one would recommend anyone in my social circle to use it. As it really brings allot of value to consumers. "

Live chat, good customer service, awesome fb group for insiders makes me stay, Although new mnvos and telco offerings has become more competitive and lower priced than Circles Life, will still stay with circles for sometime because circles once liberated me from choosing between 3 slow ineffective traditional telcos that are more monopolistic than competitive."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Customer Service: Contacted customer service via Facebook messenger with some queries when I'm not sure about some stuff. Reply is almost immediate if not just a short wait. The staff replying is also friendly.
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"I don't look much in a Telco. As long as they give me what they promise and don't overcharge me, I'm more than happy. But not only had Circles Life met that standard, they top it off by having amazing customer service and community management team. And that's a rarity in Telcos that sets Circles apart from the rest"
Level 6. Master,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Signed up for the $0 Flexi Plan. Only grouse is that they bill their data in 1 min block ""Local voice services are chargeable on a one (1) minute pulse basis for the first minute"", which meant that if you took 30 calls in which you only said ""hello"", that would be 30 mins of talktime."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Circles.Life is my favourite service provider so far! Mobile plans offered are flexible and non-binding. One point that everyone loves is the never-ending treats of free data during festivals and birthdays. 
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"What got me not so happy lately with Circles Life, was in the bid to compete with Singtel GOMO (most similar competition), they started a promo for new sign-ups.

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Circles never fail to surprise its customer with great deals like free data and events. It has a strong customer support team that is always ready to help its customer. One thing i like about its after sales service is that i do not need to call a number and listen to an automated voice asking me to press lots of number and still have to wait for 10-20 mins before a customer service officer picks up. I strongly recommend people to give circles a try.
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"The service of the staff is really phenomenal. They are so efficient and patient.  All in all, I really love the service that they provide, the flexibility you have in your own phone plans (add-ons). "

Besides that they continuously look at ways to reward their customers & constantly innovate, so much so the big 3 have to copy them in putting customers first instead of profits."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Circle Life has been a fuss-free telco. Prompt with responsive service. It is also value for money. Best is that there is no contract which gives us consumer the flexibility to change to another telco anytime.

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Of the most seamless and easy telco in terms of signing up. One can get going in less than 15 minutes - a fantastic feat compared to the long waiting times of the traditional players. As the networks rides on M1’s infrastructure - reliability and speed isn’t an issue. As for customer service, the mobile app covers most of the bases, and personally, this is a major plus point for me. In this day and age where time is a premium, finding the time to visit a telco outlet is almost impossible. And this is where Circles.Life have done well by bringing the customer service to their customers instead of the traditional model, and saving them operating  costs on which they pass the savings to their customers in the form of generous data allocations. I’m happy with Circles.Life and for those who have their hesitations, I’d recommend them to try the $0 plan to see what a spectacular ride they’re in for with Circles.Life! "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"What truly sets them apart, however, is its customer service.

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,I actually applied through a roadshow instead of the usual online application. The process from start to finish took only about 10 minutes and the employee handling the sign up process was friendly and helped me fill in everything and handed me the sim card after everything was done
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"A lot of people look at the price/value proposition of the service and concluded that it is not as good as the other providers. True. They are a MVNO, using another telco's network to provide the service but that's where things started to be different.  They have at least taken care of the current customers a bit more than the competition.  Do understand that not all services will be perfect. There are spotty connections in some odd places in Singapore. The best part is that there is no contract to tie you down so you can change to another service provider should the connection be bad. To me the best customer service is the one that allows you to leave if they are not up to your standard. For that Circles.Life gets full points from me."

Very helpful because you're not texting a robot but an actual person."

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 01 Jul 2019,None,Did not encounter any service disruption so far since I joined at the start of the year. Customer service was also top notched - I raised an enquiry when my cash back was not given and they replied promptly to inform that they will rectify it in the next month bill (and threw in free 1 GB of data that month too :D )
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 26 Jun 2019,None,"Porting over was so easy. First time I got same day sim delivery. Never thought it was possible to get so much data, they are truly game changers.

Granted I had a bump when my SIM card didn't arrive at first but all fears that I had no customer service because there was no physical shop were unfounded as they gave the most prompt and efficient service that i had in a long time.

I had to chase them to honor what I had signed up for , also i spent more time with then on chat then I would do a normal Telco. After a day I wanted to cancel they said I can't as I should have read terms and conditions that locked in to 2 billing cycles hence a 2 month contract when they advertise it to be no contract. The service is lousy, the app often crashes and it's just constantly advertising to to upsell.  Awful and big regret . Don't get sucked into their false advertising."

CONNECTION IN MRT I travelled the Purple NEL and Yellow Circleline daily, no experience of connection drop when I surf, Facebook, Instagram and watch snaps of video on those platforms while on train. Calls received were clear and no breaks too. Signals on land are pretty strong too. PRICE I'd ported in from other telco, I get an additional 2GB/month free. Total of 6GB in total only $28/month and this is without any tied down of any contract. Many other telco are starting or started to offer SIM-ONLY plans, but my personal reason to remain with Circle is because they offer 500MB/month for every 6 months you stay with them. It is a definite benefits with practicality for being a loyal customer! After two years, you get 2GB more on TOP of your 6GB at the price of $28! "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 10 Jan 2019,None,- Very very very good customer support. Speedy reply and very patient and understand. 
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Jan 2019,None,"Circles Life has good customer service and rewards their customers for their loyalty. When I contacted them about being charged for an MMS that I did not send, the Customer Care agent agreed to waive the charge right there and then - no question asked or waiting a few days to know the outcome. They also reward their customers with 500 MB bonus data for every 6 months that you stay with them. In addition, they have been giving bonus data through daily polls and on special occasions."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 29 Dec 2018,None,Good service and customer service response. Good value of money  and so far the service still never fails me.  over all great plan and service.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Sep 2018,None,"So I think they were confused on how to get me the simcard, he asked me to text my house address and maybe they will send it to me personally. Also asked me what time will I be at home. But now that I think about it, why would they ask me for my house address?? They should have all those details which I provided when I signed up on their website right?? Suspicious. Then I went to their website to Live Chat with someone at Circles Life. Ok I must say there was a person on the other side chatting to me and she was quite professional in the way she answered my question etc. She managed to waive the SGD15 charge because not my fault that this happened. 11 September - Got a call Circles Life late evening around 7PM asking me to confirm my IC number and date of issue. I happened to be in the middle of something that I didn't have wallet with me. But really? Shouldn't they already have such information??? I said to the person I am in the middle of something now I don't have the Issue Date of my IC. He said this is really urgent he's at the warehouse and needs these details to send the package out. I said I don't have the Issue Date, but I can give him my IC number la...he said ok. So gave him my IC number. All in all, I will save around SGD40 in my phone bill with Circles Life as compared to Starhub with alot more data, but perhaps the above problems shouldn't have happened as they have been around for some time now. Furthermore they shouldn't be asking for all this personal data when they should have all this in the first place right?"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 06 Aug 2018,None,the service is pretty good. easy ways to self help and self service so I don't have to spend time to go through their calling system. 
Level 6. Master,Updated on 04 Aug 2018,None,"In itself, Circles.Life is a customer-centric, marketing-focused company.  It leverages on product marketing to differentiate itself, and has been experimenting with various ways to talk to their customers, especially whenever there are inquiries.  I have been a customer since 2016 as an early adopter. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Jun 2018,None,"I must said that me and my wife have been using this circles.life plan for 4months with no hussle at all... Everything is transparent and plus no contracts at all, at any moment we can cancel if we want to without paying any termination fees. Service customer wise, they are indeed very prompt in replying and also in a freindly manner should be on live or make calls but normally thru emails as they will explain to you in a Layman terms for us to understand. The service line as well, its very clear and not to say crystal clear but it's just perfect and me and my wife took the 26GB, even till end of the month, we do still have balance GB as shown on the circles.life apps. So far we never try the whatsapp passport or roaming yet but definately going to use it one day as they will show us per day, per each countries we need to pay. "

No more being tied down by contracts, flexible - I can add on more data or even pause the plan if I’m overseas for long periods, I can monitor my phone bill and usage easily on the circles life app. It’s user-friendly and their customer service is prompt & friendly. I recommend this mobile service to everyone! Try it, change your life, be free! "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 18 May 2018,None,Circles.Life provides an accurate billing system.  Easy to manage the customize and data usage.  Good loyalty reward and customer services.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 02 May 2018,None,"Initial contact with before I decided to change to circleslife is their customer service. I signed up for their free trial past year and realize the signal at my residential address is very weak. Although they advertised as 4g island wide coverage, but the signal was only 2-3 bar most of the time. Emailed them to enquire, they replied within 2hrs! Unexpected fast reply which ""wow"" me. They helped with the issue and engaged their network team to investigate. It took about 2weeks to get back to me, but they managed to resolve the weak signal issue. Now, I'm their happy customer! Although I still encounter fluctuating signal at my residential, but it is still acceptable. Highly recommended! Moreover if you need data, they are giving free 500mb/ 6 months perpetually till you decided to end your contract with them."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 27 Apr 2018,None,Switched away only because another service provider fits my need better.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 10 Apr 2018,None,No real issues with Circles Life. But you can't do a transfer of ownership once you are an existing customer.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I've been with Circles.Life for a couple of months, and I'm happy to say that I'm pleased so far. The plan is very affordable for $28, and if you require any add-ons, you can do so with the CirclesCare app. The CirclesCare app is sleek and easy to maneuver around. One of the common complaints of Circles.Life is that its network connection can become weak when your MRT goes underground, however I've not experienced this before. Personally, one of the greatest virtue of Circles.Life is how the company always has the welfare of the public at heart. Not only is it constantly having promotions to attract potential new users to join, it is also coming up with more activities and deals for existing users too. This is something that I really appreciate of Circles.Life."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I've been on Circles for 3 months now and it has been such a refreshing experience. I really love the intuitve layout of the app and how things such as temporary suspension could be done easily. I especially love the reminders they send occassionally on the loyalty bonus, it keeps users like myself excited. But most importantly, cared about. That's why Circles wins my hearts because this is a product that is marketed and created to serve our needs. I'm really happy with all the services but since is a honest review, I shall name some bad too. Connection are bad in underground stations- There was once I lost my connection in the train from Outram to Hougang. It is only when i stepped out of the train, did I had connection. But since I stay in the West and takes the EWL, that was just one small issue. Also, the extra charge during the first month was a little shocking. Especially for me as I got the bill just 3 days after I'm with Circles, I immediately second think if I made a wrong decision haha. But nonethless, all's good, all's good! Circles please continue doing all these great stuff and I'll continue to stay loyal, get my friend onboard to earn those data heehee ❤"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,they have changed the mobile market ever since they have come on board.  Excellent customer service and extremely responsive.  It is good that they are listening and making inroads to win users over.  I am 20 months into circles and have no complaints at all.  Excellent overall connectivity from wherever I am.  
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"Happy to be circles.life customer. * User-friendly website and app, unlike SingTel. Easy to obtain any information immediately."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I was a little sceptical when Circles.Life first came out. More data with cheaper monthly bill? Sounds too good to be true to me. So I waited another year to observe this virtual telco before making the switch from SingTel. Even then, I was nervous about hidden costs, slow data, or poor customer services. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,- Manage your plan through an mobile app instead of calling through their customer support. - No customer support hotline to call
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I've been with Circles.Life for just over 2 months and the porting experience was smooth. No long waiting times over the phone/customer service counter. They also replied my many queries really quickly! As a student, even the benefits at the other telcos could not beat the price or data that I could get on Circles.Life. Currently, I'm paying $28 for 7GB/month. (no add-ons)"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,Ported my number in last year from M1 and never looked back. Super star service and more GB than I can ever imagine. Highly recommend their service.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,"Last but not least, the customer experience with circles.life has been amazing. I started with 6gb data, then i received an additional 0.5GB data on my bday, and another 2 GB data from a promotion. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,"I've been a customer of Circle.Life for 1 year and 3 months now! Here are some of the things I like and dislike about it: Customer Service: Communication with customer service is done via the Circles.Life app. Generally they have been prompt in responding on the live chat, and from past experience they are so much faster than M1 call center! Customer service officers on the other side of the live chat can troubleshoot and make changes to your account for you (for example, I chatted once to request for them to pause my plan for a few months as I was travelling overseas). One downside might be the lack of a human touch, I do miss speaking to a customer service officer over the phone. Circles.Life live chat hours are: Monday - Friday 9am to 10pm, Weekends & PH 9am to 6pm. Mobile App: Very user friendly compared and modern design, pleasant to use! Birthday treats & other bonuses: 500MB birthday bonus. When I first signed up there was also a port-in bonus, if you're switching over from another local telco. You also get referral bonus (200 MB per month for every new customer who signs up using your referral code) so there's actually no limit to the amount of bonus data you can get out of Circles.Life. Here are some of the bonuses which I have, according to the app:"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"Had been a loyal M1 customer since my poly days till fatherhood (35yo) & I remb the days when M1 rewarded their loyal customers with birthday vouchers yearly, till recent few years they have stopped giving and I had to call & 'beg' for them if I wanted to recontract or sign up new phones. Changed to Circle Life mainly for the savings of monthly bills & since they are using M1 network, I have the same network reception. What I like about Circle is their flexibility for the charges & of course the loyalty rewards (500mb extra every 6mths). Can see this telco having some impacts to the 3 main telcos & just want to say: If you treat your loyal customers well, you can be sure we will stay with you Circle Life!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"I was a Singtel customer since my dad got me the line when I was 15 so that's about 20 years. The push factor was that I never, EVER felt like I was being treated like a loyal customer. In fact, I've had too many instances where they were just plain low balling me (e.g. Birthday treats can't be redeemed, mysterious charges on the bill). But it wasn't easy leaving a long-term relationship no matter how detrimental it might be. Plus, I was a singtel circle member so I got free data on Sundays."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"Circles Life has got to be the most value-added telco service. These are the few reasons why: 1) They are generous with their data! I live for data, and they understand customers like us (hahaha) 2) Great customer service. They could answer my questions so quickly, and settle my concerns. I like that they are so easy to reach. - sometimes when we want to reach their customer service rep through the app, they dont respond immediately and I dont like to wait with the app on. So by the time I came back to the app after scrolling somewhere else, the conversation was closed by the rep. Can be better managed!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,I have been using Circles for more than a year now and overall pretty happy with the service. 1. Just simply love the amount of customisation options available through their Circles Care App -  No more waiting to get through to customer service over a call 😀. There is even an option to chat with customer service through the app in case a need arises. 
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"It has been exactly a year since I’ve ported over to Circles life from Singtel, and I’m happy to say that it’s been awesome! Not only do I get 6Gb of data monthly, after 6 months of usage, I’m awarded with another 500Mb of monhly data as a loyal customer. On top of that, I get an additional 500mb when it’s my birthday! How cool is that! But there’s one factor which I love about Circles the most, and it’s the connectivity. When I was using SingTel, I often face issues with connectivity when I travel on the MRT. SingTel always resets its connection on certain stations along the track. This gives me problem especially when I’m watching a movie or playing some games. With Circles, this hasn’t been a problem ever since. Hence Circles truly rules with its connectivity! "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"While their customer service and SIM card delivery processes can be better improved, no other complains so far."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"I had done my tour of duty with the three telcos & thought I would stay with green until Circles came along. Great, fast and effective customer service along with value for money plans that gave me what I needed (and not rubbish I don need like 300 mins talk time) ensures that Circles is the one for me. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"1. Short customer service waiting time - If you have a problem with anything, the live chat can get you sorted out. Plus, it takes less than 5 minutes (usually instant) to reach support. Out of 10 problems, 9 times were resolved instantly for me. The other one time took 2 hours as they had to settle something back end. 3. No Physical Shops - Being a digital telco, they don't have any physical shops at all if you want to talk to a live person. However, they hold roadshows from time to time at various parts of Singapore."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4d ago,Purchased,"The CNY package was attractive so I switched over mine and my wife's mobile plan from M1 to MyRepublic. My line was ported over without issue but my wife's took more than a week. Customer service was hard to reach but eventually when engaged the person was helpful and resolved the issue. It took a few days though. Customer service seem to try to hide behind chatbot and website, very hard to contact with no clearly visible phone number shown anywhere. The chatbot is totally useless and website form produces no response. Except for the CS rep whom has been very helpful, overall customer service experience was poor. Also, recently found out MyRepublic does not support mobile phone payment. One of my auto-subscription could not charge successfully. Also my wife's apple watch could not connect to MyRepublic mobile data. Not sure if MyRepublic does not support Apple Watch or what. Not feeling enthusiastic about contacting customer service again!"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"It’s been almost 2 weeks since I tried porting my number over from Starhub. Tried to call their customer service hotline to enquire about the unsuccessful application only to be directed to a chatbot that will direct me to links of articles or answers to FAQ which was extremely unhelpful.  With the unsuccessful porting application, they said they will contact me with the reason only to receive an email with the reason for unsuccessful application with no additional follow up emails on information needed to resubmit the application or the status update of the application. They only resubmitted an application when I sent in a request form only to be informed that my application was unsuccessful. I had to call in to starhub to enquire about it but they told me there was no request from myrepublic to port the number over. I am extremely disappointed in the service I received and I even had to pay for the one month of service already, only to receive this subpar experience. Would not recommend it to any of my friends or family until you learn to improve on your customer service support."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"Network speed could be slightly faster for some grey area. Nonetheless, the 50gb plan for $17 is really worth the value as compared to other service provider."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 23 Dec 2020,Purchased,"Network is unstable and weak in certain locations of Singapore, even though it is quite populated. Whenever in indoor buildings, the data service is unstable and laggy, especially when underground, which is common in many shopping malls. Coverage can be improved as such. [Customer Service] Support is friendly and helpful, helping with the porting over and resolving some issues with it. Whether it is at brick and motar stores or online websites, the staff is also there to help."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 23 Dec 2020,Purchased,Network is tip top. And delivery of SIM card was timely and porting was an ease. Overall pleasant service thus far. Highly recommend MyRepublic if you are big on quality data without having to spend hundreds monthly.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 12 Dec 2020,Purchased,"Reception was ok at beginning and became unstable , weirdly after I ported to another telco realised my phone is speed is up!!!! And I thought it’s my phone problem in the past. Impossible to get customer service via call or chat despite making over 20 attempts. Was charged $10 surcharge for failed payment . Wasn’t apparent in the t and c but nevermind. Took the u limited plan but they refused to show your monthly usage, a sly trick to keep you from porting . Now I port to another telco with 110gb and never will look back. Tolerated sucky service for over a year. My republic keep up the good work and keep oppressing your customers. I sense a mass exodus soon and a chapter 11 on the way. Too frightened of the boo boos to even try them again. My republic mobile does a good job of Messing up and in process create customer opportunity for Singtel StarHub and M1. The other telcos should give my republic a medal for the good work and should ask them to keep it up 👍"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 06 Dec 2020,None,"When you guys just started up, My first service was a broadband line with you guys, for 2 years, I NEVER had to call the customer service line, I NEVER had to go through any service disruption, basically for 2 years, I just pay my bills on time. When my contract expired, I took another 2 years with you guys. I also ported my personal mobile line, my parents line to you guys. Same thing, NEVER had to call the customer service line and etc and even though there was one bad mobile service disruption. You guys handled it well, but announcing and did your best to restore the service."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 12 Nov 2020,Purchased,"Although it is on M1 network and there are many horror stories about how bad it is, I have not personally experienced any significant slowdown / loss of network myself (There are spots in my house where the data is weaker than Starhub but not unusable). The plan is great value for money (Signed up during flash sales and got 50GB for only $17, much better than what Circles.Life and others offer). The only downside was I engaged their support team before and they gave incorrect advice regarding the flash sales. Otherwise, it has been great and definitely recommend this!"

Really need the speed for gaming, watching Youtube videos, streaming and download large work files. [Customer Service] This department is the best! Still freshly remember that time when my network is down at 2am, I call them up and they gladly to help and guide me patiently to reset my router. And making sure that my network is up and running when they called me back after I troubleshoot the router's issue. Lastly, even though there are some negative comments from the customers and high doubts from non-customers of porting over, take that as a challenge to improve, fulfill your customer's requirements, showing your best to promo good plans to non-customers.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,"However, porting over from Singtel encountered some issues which required escalation to their backend team for investigation. Even though both the app and chat support told me my number porting was successful, that was not the case. I was still on the temporary number. My original number had been ported and deactivated (M1 automated message: ""line not in use"" when I tried to dial). IIRC, that took less than a week to resolve but had caused inconvenience whenever accessing services required SMS OTPs."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,"I have just signed up with MyRepublic, the line seems ok and the service was great when I sign up.  Hassle free and the SIM card was delivered to me in 3 days."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,Tried different mvno. This suits me the best and most affordable especially outgoing and incoming calls from overseas. My wife got convinced and our family is using the same plan. Porting is simple and trouble free. I was unavailable for the initial delivery. The online chat was seamless and helpful to setup another delivery date in just a minute. I wish other telco would provide value and service as good as myrepublic.

MyRepublic had happily deducted the money from my credit card but porting was unsuccessful. There was no way to get in touch with the customer service. We are expected to speak to a chatbot to solve our matters. This is one aspect that MyRepublic needs to buck up.  MyRepublic, you have got a great value for money plans and amazing marketing (the kiddy fonts that you used in Ms-Word and you dared to use it in Facebook? it somehow enticed me!) but what are those things when we cannot reach you to solve our issue? When there is a fire breaking out, are you expecting the citizens to talk to a chatbot? Customers do not like to hang on the line and talk to the CS too"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Jul 2020,Purchased,This is a simple and extremely affordable no-fuss plan. The data connection speed is comparable to other major telcos and the phone connection is also stable. What I like the most is there is no excess data usage even if you go beyond the allocated data (except that the connection speed is compromised). Payment is via debit/credit deduction monthly. The app is also basic  and user friendly. Overall it is highly recommended.

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 08 Jul 2020,Purchased,I have been a regular subscriber of this telco. Currently I am paying $8 for the monthly 1GB plan which I think is one of the cheapest so far. But competitors are now providing better offerings. So MyRepublic may have to up its ante to retain its customer base.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Jul 2020,Purchased,"I was formerly a StarHub customer and found the StarHub SIM plans to be quite expensive. So I decided to try out MyRepublic, and the experience has been overwhelmingly positive.  [Customer Service] The only hicccup occurred when I was signing up for 2 SIM cards and had to use different email accounts, but the MyRepublic team quickly responded to my request to bring the 2 SIM cards under 1 account and email id. The application process can be fine-tuned in this aspect, to allow a new MyRepublic user to sign up for multiple services at the same time. Overall, a great plan if you’re not a heavy data user, and with more-than-enough SMS and call-time for the average person"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Jul 2020,Purchased,My Republic plan is really value for money! Registration was quick and SIM card was immediately activated. Network and internet speed was stable and fast comparing with the big telco companies. Customer service was also excellent. Keep it up!

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 03 Jun 2020,Purchased,"I switched from M1 to Myrepublic when it first started.  A lot of my friends were sceptical of the reliability. Due to the lower price, and the fact that it sits on Starhub infrastructure, I decided to give it a try.  I am satisfied with the service provided.  In fact, I have also switched my child and my company tel to MyRepublic.  It has saved me lots of $.  I am in no way related to MyRepublic.  Just sharing my honest feedback abt their service.  Btw, I also like their music when I ring their customer service.  Very cheerful and happy."

Hence, I got the customer service to help me change the address and regenerate the bill with the new address. However, they sent me the bill with the old address and they cannot do anything about it. Hence, they suggested I subscribe another line and pay the full amount again with NO REFUND to get the billing address right. This is outrageous!"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 21 May 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] I tried to apply online for a $10/mth plan for my son. After keying in all my details, I was asked to put a $100 deposit based on their ""assessment of my profile"". I find that highly ludicrous, as my profile has no indication of my financial status nor credit rating. In fact, I have never had outstanding mobile bills and I have a good credit rating. The only thing I can deduce is that they suspect a 36 year old woman living in a HDB flat, who has internet access and a credit card to apply for this line, cannot afford to pay $10 a month for a mobile plan. What a big joke. Will boycott My Republic forever!"

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Customer service via phone takes a long time but expected. Best way to contact them is via messenger. Mobile broadband is generally quite fast and stable. Using it for gaming is generally stable as well. Telco service is good and convenient since you can buy roaming data via the app. Coverage is not fantastic but decent enough. They have great online services like app and messenger but via telephone takes a long time. I don't mind actually as I feel messenger is more convenient.

Nothing beats speaking to a Live person for urgent and peculiar issue for resolution.

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 22 Dec 2020,Purchased,"I first ported over to giga when they were first introduced and hopped on the (back then) $18 for 20gb plan which has now been upgraded to 40gb. Customer service used to be quick and efficient but it is now absolutely terrible and a pain to contact customer service for assistance. The mobile app is also terrible and it doesn't always load although it is slightly better now. Would rate customer support as zero stars if possible. The live agent does not work at all and the support staffs do not reply to their email. I have been contacting them for almost a month now to try to change my credit card on my account but customer service either does not reply or provides responses asking for a screenshot and then completely disappears after I send a screenshot of my error message. I believe I am not the only one facing issues with credit card as my family member is encountering the same issue and I saw reviews on seedly of people mentioning this same error.  I sent my last follow up email 5 days ago requesting for assistance (their automated replies state that I will receive a reply within 72 hours but I only receive a reply after I send a second follow up email after 72 hours) and have yet to receive a reply from them. I have made it clear that I was absolutely dissatisfied with their terrible service and have made known to them that I will file an official complain to IMDA for this lack of customer support. If it is a problem with manpower, they absolutely should try to hire more support staff given how much they've grown thus far, and if the credit card issue was a technical error, they could at least kindly inform me that they are trying to fix it instead of completely not replying to all the emails I have sent them. I believe I am not the only one who is unhappy with this lack of customer support from giga and would urge anyone who feels the same to contact me so we can lodge a complain to IMDA together as I believe if I were to do so alone, IMDA would not take it seriously. Still stuck with giga for now because their plans are really one of the most value for money but I will not hesitate to hop to another telco should this terrible service continue."

The network is fast and I have no problems so far. The pricing for the plans are one of the best and they frequently surprise me with pop up deals and perks too. Sometimes they even give additional data for free! The app is very user friendly with cool profile animations and shows you all your usage stats in one glance. You can easily view the pricing for all the add-ons and easily add them within seconds in the app. There is a chat for customer support within the app and I usually get a reply within seconds.

I have also reached them via email on Sunday night, but now its Tuesday morning and no one gotten back to me.

But all my fears were unwarranted when I realized how quick the number can be ported. Not just that, the billing and upgrade was seamless. I did not even need to reach out to any customer service person at all.  The app is easy to use and you can self-service to add on data, roaming etc any time.  I was previously a Starhub customer and I did not feel any difference in the 4G or data connection. The network is good. Prior to COVID, I also subscribe to GIGA! roaming plan before.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 04 Aug 2020,Purchased,"I tried a lot of other mobile plan/networks and so far Giga is the best. Normally cheaper mobile network tends to be unstable but Giga rides on the Starhub so its very stable and the range is superb. Customer service can be reached easily within the app, very convenient and fast. The porting in is a bit slower than circle line but still acceptable. I like that Giga has smaller package to suit my useage I do not have to pay more for the data I do not need, and in months I need more, can always buy the extra in just a heartbeat on the app. Roaming and international data can also be bought extra with super cheap price that I dont need to change sim. I introduce to a lot of friends and they all have very nice experience. It can not be better than this."

Also obvious that giga is very customer-focused cos I can't ""accidentally"" exceed my data anymore 💸, and the plan has a lot of free add-ons which other telcos will charge for... which I appreciate! So far the network speed has been really solid too so it's def a great deal."
Level 6. Master,Updated on 23 Jul 2020,None,Not 5 stars for network because I think the coverage still does not beat Singtel but honestly I think it will work for the average person. It was only slow to the point of cannot use in military camp which is in a 'ulu' place. But else where its legit like Singtel speed. I think giga most value in terms of gb/$ plus got free rollover. now i'm on a promo plan $20 for 40gb (orginally $18 for $20). i don't like circles promos because they seem like temporary like for customer acquisition only but later on doesn't really reward loyal customers so i go for giga which is value throughout. app wise the animation a bit lag but who cares. never tried the customer support so can't comment.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Jul 2020,Purchased,The apps are simple and easy to use despite minimum personal attention. Well done. The rolling over of data monthly is good. But the Call time could be increased.

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 25 Jun 2020,None,"Porting was seamless and done without any hiccup. The customer's role in the porting process besides signing up is to exchange the Sim card. Porting was done quickly, and you will receive updates from Giga via SMS on the successful porting.  One of the best if not the best mobile app experience. The quirky designs and colour scheme might be a personal taste issue. However, the experience of using the app is outstanding. Information you need are prominently placed and easy to read. Addons are well laid out. Information about each addon is clearly stated. Billing is done on the app without being redirected to another webpage. Its surprising to see GIGA with a much well-designed app than Starhub's offering. You can easily add/upgrade/downgrade your line with ease in App. [Customer Service] The weakest component of Giga. Customer service is just bad. Response time is painfully slow. This is written based on my initial experience with them hence I’m not sure if any improvements have been made. Thankfully, I only have to reach out to them once. This shows the reliabilty of their service.  Giga! has increible potential to deliver the best mobile experience once they figure out how to fix their customer support issues. It is still my favourite telco and have since ported mutiple lines over."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 23 Jun 2020,None,"[Billing] The beauty of giga is you will not experience bill shock. It’s a postpaid service on a prepaid platform.  Please note that I am rating this based on above mentioned experience. I have not came across any customer service with them because I didn’t went into any communication with them, which I know I try to avoid knowing how service level has lapsed over the service industry over the years just like M1.

They make you wait for hours, tell you submit feedback, ignore your emails, ignore your submitted feedback. And then at the end they have the cheek to ask you for more patience. If you ever get charged the wrong amount, forget trying to get it back. Get charged $100 for some roaming service you didn't activate? Too bad, it's gone forever. giga! = thief."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 04 Jan 2021,Purchased,"Signed up for a gomo sim only plan on 17 dec. My husband used his credit card to pay for the fee but I filled in all my personal details correctly. Got my card on 19 dec, even received a confirmation email addressed to my name. Then gomo later sends me an sms on 21 dec to inform me of porting over issues from M1 and ask me to contact M1. I called M1 and said no issues on their side for me to port over to gomo. So okay, i wait until 30 Dec to chat with their officer on the gomo app. Officer asks me to fill in a form as there was some mismatch in the personal details which is already super stange if i only key in my own details. I fill in the form, officer acknowledges receipt and tells me to wait 24-48 hrs for the confirmation sms. Up till today, 4 Jan, no confirmation email sent so I chat with another officer on the gomo app who tells me that there don't have an account registered under my name. So i get my husband to ask another officer again and this time that officer tells me that they had sent me an sms on 21 dec to inform me that they were going to cancel my plan because i didn't fill in the form to verify my personal details. B) why do my personal details not match in the first place when I keyed them in correctly. C) customer service officers clearly are not helpful. Claim that they informed me via sms of the cancellation and no refund. Is this a scam or what?? They advertise promo they cancel contract on customers and claim no refund."

The chatbot is user friendly unless you have complicated issue may need some time to resolve.

Good thing its carried by the first-jobber bright-eyed-bushy-tailed youth promoters.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 27 Apr 2020,Purchased,"Everything has been smooth sailing for me, i've been using GOMO for a couple of months. Already a singtel user i had to pay an upfront fee to port the line over to a sim-only. Other than that, fees have been $20 monthly auto-deduction as usual. The customer support is, however, trash. ""Chat"" function on the app worked once. When I tried again, the message couldnt't go through and yeah I just gave up because I didn't have a pressing need."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Apr 2020,Purchased,Then I went thru their retarded website bot (like 14 times) and got a human support finally. The person say NO REFUND once delivery starts. WTF? I got no service from your sh1tty sim pay me back my $20.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Mar 2020,Purchased,"In my opinion, Singtel GOMO provides the best value for sim only plans. Billing is easy where payment is automatically deducted from your bank account monthly. Besides that, easy to sign up as it can be done online and sim card will be delivered to you. However, they are lacking in terms of customer service. When signing up for this plan, I encountered some difficulties and I was looking for some form of customer support. Tried using the robo chat which apparently was the only way for me to talk to someone, but didn't manage to have my queries cleared. There wasn't any contact number on their GOMO site therefore I decided to contact Singtel, only to be told by the staff that the robo chat was the only way for me to contact someone. After many times of trying to search for an answer from the robo chat, I was finally directed to a customer service personnel. It wasn't clear that I had to search multiple times, and only be directed if I couldn't have my queries cleared, which actually resulted in me wasting so much time trying to contact someone."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Mar 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] [Ease of porting] Literally got scammed by Gomo since they refused to redeliver or refund my SIM card when I missed the first delivery; they should consider clarifying that one delivery attempt is all you'll get. They basically made me pay $20 for a failed delivery attempt, and claimed I took too long to reschedule (too long defined as 9 working days) after misdirecting me to SingPost on my first attempt with customer support. Went through customer support 6 times (yes, that's 6 times I interacted with their infamous chatbot too) and each ended with either misdirection or eventual rejection by supervisors for redelivery or refund request, even when the customer support representatives proposed said resolutions.  So in the end, I have a $20 deficit with no Gomo plan that I paid for; simply appalling that an established business (in this case Singtel) can receive payment without delivering stated service. Claims of best network are pointless when your users can't even have a decent port in or customer support experience. "

They did asked me to call SingPost regarding the delivery but it was my fault that I didn’t because I forgot. But I didn’t receive any email/sms regarding the delivery. How is it fair?

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Feb 2020,Purchased,"Horrendous customer service.  Firstly, i had to change over ownership of the number from my parents to myself. I purchased the GOMO plan, before proceeding down to my service provider to transfer ownership. I had to pay $20+ for the transfer of ownership but that's alright. After that, i was informed that i had to commit to a minimum 1 month SIM only plan. My GOMO sim was scheduled to be collected in 2 days. I don't understand their rationale as I informed them early 2 days prior to my collection date. Assuming that collection can be done as soon as next day, obviously they haven't started with the application/port over yet. Such a shame that the company is covetous over that $20 and gave up on the possibility of a long-term customer. Extremely disappointed with the service that I got and would seek another provider instead."

Rookie,Posted on 27 Oct 2019,Purchased,"Giving it a month to see if the coverage improves, living ten minutes from a town, gomo has a coverage map that says in my area the coverage is excellent 4g, on a rare occasion 4g is available, always 3G and two or three bars on iPhone. This isn’t good enough as three are able to have 4g consistently. Do not rely on their coverage map if in a rural area(if ten mins from a town either side is rural). Contacted their customer service who told me the 4g mast was down in my area. Was tempted to message back and offer my services to go to the location and put the mast back up. Didn’t appreciate being spoofed by someone who had no clue what they were talking about. Point is these phone companies offer a service that is not what you get, for ten euro a month to struggle to load a page on your phone in 2019 is ridiculous. Maybe don’t jump ship to gomo so quickly until you see what other people in your area make of the service.

Tried all sorts of ways as per advised by customer chat representative. None of them worked. Even went to phone shops for assistance. Phone is OnePlus 7t. Because of this, I decided to switch to GIGA but was unable to port-in successfully. Emailed redOne only to find out that I had arrears (of which I did not know) and that they've cut the line without informing me whatsoever. Paid the arrears because I seriously couldn't take them anymore only to find out that I had to pay $20 to reconnect the line if I wanted to port-in successfully to GIGA and redOne was unable to waive those charges even when it was their fault. Extremely disappointed."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 17 Dec 2019,Purchased,"You can sign up at any Challenger stores in Singapore and even some mobile shops, refer to the redONE website for their agents. There is also an option to sign up by porting in, but you must have a postpaid plan first. Signing up through redONE agent is a seamless 10mins process, my mobile number is automatically activated within 2 hours after signing up. Sign up now to enjoy free registration! (redONE website indicates that their registration fees of SGD30 is waived until further notice, you must still pay a one-off sim card fees of SGD10) The redONE SG 1App is very user friendly, it allows you to track the usage for all your redone mobile numbers. You can also top up your mobile service with various add-ons on the app too. "

My wife was using another service provider whenever she went to the basement of shopping mall there will be no network.but Red One was full bar through out."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Dec 2019,Purchased,"Most other telcos are not interested to offer low-priced plans, but i think this is precisely what the market needs. There are people who aren't heavy users, and only require very basic call and data usage. In this aspect, redONE has not only filled a unique market gap, but has also found their niche on cross-border services. This is truly the perfect telco for Malaysians commuting daily to Singapore for work, and a lifesaver for Singaporeans making occasional trips to Malaysia, but do not want to activate roaming and incur extra roaming charges. My initial gripe was that they do not have an actual shopfront for signing-up. But the good news is, they have quite a number of venues (they call it 'agents') in which you can register for their service. I signed up for mine at Challenger Bugis. A lady working at Challenger did the registration for me using an iPad. Entire process only took about 10-15 mins. Not bad for a first impression. Why can't other telcos be this efficient?! I've been using the service for about a month now. No issues so far. Usage can easily be monitored on their app. I made my first payment through the app too. Never been happier with a telco. This is truly a gem."

At the 2nd month, I suddenly realised I am being charge 3 times and when I submitted for customer support and even raise the issue with IMDA, there isn’t anything done. I checked through all accounts and no reflection in any of the invoices. Due to the suspicious transaction, I did a chargeback with the bank and they change a credit card for me.

Since I live near the central, so I met with fewer issues. Customer service is the worst part of TPG Mobile. There is none, strictly speaking and you must be the type of customer who can tolerate and ignore any indifference of the service from your other mobile services unless you have time (an hour or two) to queue to talk to counter staff. Emailing TPG is as good as talking to the wall. No reply unless you are extremely lucky.  If you can let go the cheap subscription, there is no reason you should use its service for a peace of mind.

For $10 per month for 50GB and 300 minutes, TPG is a phenomenal deal that I am happy to get and forgo some human being hand holding me.

Both times it was serviceable and I could keep in contact over WhatsApp (voice call and messages) and Telegram, and even check out Reddit on occasion.

First response to a chat took minutes, first response to an email was done within the same day. This is refreshing compared to how customer service was handled over at Giga.  To each their own, but personally I find the use of eKYC smart. It allows Grid Mobile to send the SIM card via post as opposed to having a courier sending it down and physically verifying you. Very useful for people who are usually out and about and may not have anyone at home to attend to mail.  However so, would love to put a little 'g' on my home screen, perhaps Grid Mobile could make a more iOS-friendly shortcut (sorry, not sure about how it works on Android!) where users can just add to home screen a nice icon that automatically opens the gridPortal while waiting for an app?

I had assured my fren that M1 CS is very good and will always try to help esp when you needed to place another order and not completely cancel the contract. Even though 1627 told me it was possible, 1623 was insistent it would not change the order or allow a cancellation in any manner. It was very disappointing to me and my fren.

Overall, I am still a supporter of M1. On a whole, I'm glad I changed to this telco because of the good customer service and reliability. The transfer from one telco to M1 was seamless and I had no cut off in my network which was great because it would have been troublesome to be without my phone line. Secondly, would like to praise the customer service for being fast and helpful. There were times in the past years that I have i) lost my sim card and ii) needed help with network overseas that I needed to call in to the customer service and they have been nothing short of helpful. Even overseas, they manage to waive my overseas call charges to them.

I remember my colleagues and I did nail art painting in office during lunchtime...those were the days! so nostalgic. In the past, when mobile numbers are not easily ported to another telco, the primary reason is inertia. However, since porting mobile no. is no longer an issue,  if you ask me why I didn't switch to other telco providers, to me, M1 has been nimble enough to provide plans with good value for their customers.  And even when my sibling's working in Singtel is asking me to switch...I refused! Haha. Because my M1 sim-only plan has so much value. FYI, I'm on 30GB data plan at $33.75 (incl. Caller ID & Itemised Bill service). I watch an hour of YouTube video each day on my commute to work, and I'm still not even using half of the data."
Level 6. Master,Updated on 21 Jan 2020,Purchased,"I have been an M1 customer for more than 5 years now. M1's network has been pretty stable, with some intermittent issues occasionally. However, one thing I must commend is that the customer service hotline is really much better than the other telcos. I've had to wait for over an hour just to hear a human voice on the other telcos, but so far have managed to speak to a customer service rep within 5 minutes on M1, sometimes even immediately. The mobile app is also pretty convenient, is able to help me track my usage with 1 view on the dashboard, and I have so far been able to apply for value-added services easily. "

After using them extensively for 4 years, they sent me a bill of over 1000 SGD due to data roaming charges even though I had network lock enabled. Turns out that if you are in a country without partner network, the network lock won't prevent you from connecting to networks M1 doesn't partner with. What's more, the information on the M1 app is misleading and unclear. Also, the SMS that is meant to prevent you from incurring data charges of more than 100 dollars is also nonsense - I disabled data roaming immediately and my charge is 10 times more! To top it all, they don't want to waive those charges and they expect me to pay for their mistakes. I am switching to another provider. "

During my call I got information and could try it again, but they didn't correctly explain me how it worked, so I lost again my money. After 3 phone calls and one visit to the shop, I discovered my fault, but if someone told me earlier I would not lose my money twice. furthermore you can't keep the data not used on the previous month and today I had the problem that my data was expired, no problem I switched of my data, but all the money I still had on my account and was not used for anything was gone.

Excellent customer service on the phone.. Don't have too many attitude problems and they are very patient.. Even when you see them in person at the shop ( i patronise the clementi branch ) was a sucker for the free m1 calls to 3 m1 numbers and it saved me a lot of money. On top of that still benefit from multi lines and corporate discounts. I can't rmb which discount i am on right now. Only con is that they downgraded my 12gb to x gb a long time ago without me knowing raaarrrrr. Connection when compared to star hub side by side is much better. Have considered switching before but can't find any plans that fits my needs and at this cost. Hope they give us more loyalty rewards hehehe. Also their old mysim plan gives others a run for their money. Not gonna recontract. They also have an app that does the basics for tracking purpose.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 27 Jan 2021,None,"[Customer Service] The issue at stake is the fact that while Starhub can repackage their channels (which is their prerogative) it can not do so at the expense of their current customers, which is what Starhub is doing, and getting away with. So the hard choices you refer to are hard only for the customers (hundreds of customers, who are all fuming right now), not for Starhub. If you were really concerned about your customers, you would retain the choices of the current customers (or offer something equivalent), while offering whatever you want to offer to entice new customers. Anything else is simply lip service to customer service."

Starhub needs to employ people with common sense. Respect and save your customer's time. They also wrongfully billed me for an Amazon Prime membership which could not be cancelled.

I only onboarded with Starhub to get a phone at the best price, which I soon regretted due to the poor customer service and telco service. When I went overseas, they charged roaming fees despite me turning off roaming - I called to cancel the fees and explain the error, and the customer service was dismissive about it and took more than a few months to do a refund. The data service is laggy as well as compared to Circles, which I use now. It's also at an average/higher price point, which doesn't justify it's poor service and delay. All in all, I'd avoid Starhub services in the future due to the presence of better local alternatives."

I have IDD built in my plan and they constantly charges small amounts into my monthly bills and when challenged, some of it got waived, was a sneaky more and this was one of my main push to switch providers.  in summary, if $$, customer service and coverage is not important for your phone plan, you can consider them, otherwise, skip and move on.

I called starhub helpline (for my internet issue) previously, and it counted all that time (even tho i dialed 1800) as talktime used up. I nearly busted my 100mins due to it.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Jun 2019,None,Starhub has the lousiest customer service. They messed up our connections in the move to fiber and to date we cannot have a workable solution despite filing many complains. We will have to find other vendors.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Apr 2019,None,"StarHub's customer service has certainly improved over the years. While I used to have to wait on the phone for ~1h to speak to a human being, nowadays I can just send in an enquiry (via email/webform) and I will receive an email/call the next day to follow up on my case. I once even received a call on a Saturday. Really feel that they have taken steps to improve customer service and satisfaction, so kudos to them. Overall, StarHub's mobile coverage is pretty good and fast. Sometimes it lags a bit, but for the most part it works fine. I wish they would include free SMS in their plans (though I do recognise it's not a popular service anymore) and give bill rebates for a longer time, considering the equivalent plans in other telcos cost around $20 only.

I didn't know this option, never did it and I also cannot find this option in the app. Even there is an option to terminate the second sim, why activate a $100 plan for me?  It is totally a scam.

Reception is pretty bad at some parts of Singapore and in trains. My siblings are all also slowly switching out to Circles Life for its data plans. Additionally, they charged me around $100 for the switch even though my plan has already ended."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Oct 2018,None,"Used to give royalty rewards for contract renewal, now they do not appreciate royal customer anymore."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,I had been a StarHub subscriber since 2003 and the true value for me had been the savings from having the full suite of services available.  I had been a HubClub member since it started and most of the time a Platinum Club member.  The savings I get from these are pretty significant in the range of $20-30 each month.  Besides that HubClub allows me to recontract annually on one of my plans which allowed me to buy a new iPhone every time it is launched and make money selling the old one (the 2nd price is more than the recontract price I have to pay).  This is even more savings for me.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service]  I've found it fast and responsive, possibly even better than speaking with a person over the phone as you don't have to hang around and wait for your call to be connected. I've also been pleasantly surprised by how they've gone the extra mile. I lost my phone and needed a replacement SIM card. The request was processed quickly and they said they would dispatch the replacement by normal mail. This is reasonable and what I expected. I got a call an hour later asking if I'd be at home later in the day as someone would drop the SIM card off. I said I wouldn't but they could just leave it under the door. The replacement was indeed delivered later that day and it was clear one of their staff hand-delivered it (there was no courier note and it was in a hand-labelled envelope). Sort of reminds me of what a lean start-up trying their best to keep their customers happy would do. Who knows, maybe it was the CEO who hand-delivered the package. It felt strangely authentic and personal. So, full marks for this! The line was ported over in the middle of the night so I didn't suffer any actual inconvenience. Porting the number over is as convenient/inconvenient compared to other service providers. I don't think there can be a 100% seamless experience regardless of who you switch to. It's just how it is.  The only issue I had was when I eagerly tried my ViviFi SIM card the moment M1 cut my service. I don't think the port-over process had been completed yet so my iPhone registered the new temporary ViviFi number, messing up my FaceTime and iMessage. Couldn't remove the new number. I spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this (ViviFi couldn't help me unfortunately) but eventually I found out that I just had to wait for Apple to update its servers and I could re-register my ported over number. Long story short it wasn't ViviFi's fault and I think a potential issue when one changes providers. Best to just not do anything till after ViviFi's specified port-over period."
Level 6. Master,Updated on 02 Feb 2021,Purchased,"They used singtel network, so I think the reception and signal is the best out there already. Just don't expect any customer service. The website is quite bare minimum, and there is no app to track live usage, so that means you have to log in to the website to check. For me, I had some problems with the delivery of the sim cards, so the delivery guy had to come again, at my own expense of course. One of the cheapest plan for their who don't need a lot of data, so can't complain much."

Wrote in again and the service feedback with an email, which received as spam, asking if I want to terminate or port out. But can’t explain why people need to write to them to apply for “port out”, while I already instructed then to terminate. They just want your money. You won’t be able to know if your line is terminate until you see the card bill. Sorry you will be charged for another month because it will only terminate the service at the end of the month. My request in early Nov didn’t end the service, and I will be charged for Jan full month. How about Feb? I am not sure. When they decide not to feedback your email. You don’t know what they are up to."

There was a time when I had to reach out to the customer service for an enquiry and my query was answered promptly within a day. Kudos to the great customer service. All in all, I would definitely recommend subscribing to Vivifi."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"To start, there is no port-in or registration fee if you choose to pick up the SIM card in person, where pick up points are conveniently located at various MRT stations.  VIVIFI Lite is especially suited for consumers who already have frequent access to WiFi and thus do not need much mobile data, with 3GB offered. They are also for those who would appreciate being able to make reliable calls across the island frequently, since it includes a call time of 500 minutes. SMSs are kept to a low of 20, which is fine since the average person does not even use SMS anymore."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"Network is impeccable since it is using Singtel's infrastructure. So far no experience of dead spots. I have the habit to put my phone to airplane mode at night. But I noticed that upon turning back on the phone, the connectivity to 4G+ is quite instant without noticeable lag. Despite Vivifi being a MVNO, the customer service is considered quite good. Prompt response through the WhatsApp customer chat. Billing cycle is at every first day of the month. So you don't have to headache when is your next billing cycle. Best part is, if you finish using either your entitled air time, data, or SMS of the month, you got to top up value to the wallet before able to reload the service that you require. As I use this line mainly for work purpose, it is good that I do not exceed either my call time or data and get charged automatically. I have the freedom of choice on whether I want to top up and pay or not. Can't comment on the porting because I took a new number. Mobile App wise, I don't see any so far. But the web account has been clean and friendly to use. Easy to navigate around and easy to understand. Overall, extremely happy with the service provided. I would highly recommend Vivifi if the plans that they provide serves your usage needs."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"Hello friends, writing this review to share my awesome experience with Vivifi. I was not at all happy with my last operator and their customer service was so pathetic and giving false information over and over. Finally I decided to move out of that operator. I was browsing through the best operators currently in Singapore and I got a lots of them! It was really hard to choose between them, however, as per my usage and need I selected Vivifi and was not very sure whether my expectation will fulfill. To my great surprise the purchase process just took couple of minutes and as promised they delivered the new SIM in just 2 days! More to my surprise this request was actually for a port in number and I was scary what will happen to my old number if port in fails, but the process was like driving your car in an empty highway! The day the new SIM was delivered that night only the port in happened without any interruption as it took place between 12 am and 4 am. Next day morning when I switched on my phone the port in success message was delivered and it was so sweet :-) Till now there is no problem in tracking my usage, no issue in internet speed, call quality is very good. Hope this service provider get greater mileage and continuously improve their service to retain new customer base."

Additionally, I have noticed there were no delays while receiving OTPs for online purchases or so. Its the best service provider with qualities at a cheaper price. They don't have the mobile app, but they have a home page and you can see your data usages and other details. Depending on your usages, you can choose the plans and prices were very competitive or cheaper when compared to others like Singtel or StarHub.  Overall, I am very happy with the service and this company should run longer in Singapore."

At first I was hesitant about switching over to VMNO due to bad reviews on social medias that no human CS available to attend to their issues.

Hence I decided to give Vivifi a try. I'm happy with their service now and no network interruption so far.
