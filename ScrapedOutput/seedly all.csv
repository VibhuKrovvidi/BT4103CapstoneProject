Level 4. Prodigy,Updated 5d ago,Purchased,"I am writing this as i intend to switch to another telco. Reason being Circles network is really poor. I have been with Circles for some time, the benefits are really generous and customer service is prompt and friendly. But network is core when it comes to selecting a quality telco. Probably M1 network has been deteriorating and Circles that leech onto M1 network is implicated. Thus, its users indirectly affected."

I switched over from singtel to the 100 GB plan and have managed to roll over my unused data to the max of 300 GB. I also got their multisim product which allows me to share all that data on my phone with my iPad, a super useful feature when I am meeting clients outside the office. Signal is good around my office area in the CBD and I haven't encountered any issues when visiting my clients around the island either.

Probably the slowest network I’ve been on. I’ve tried SingTel, StarHub, and a couple of MVNOs on those networks like GIGA and Grid. They all worked marvelously and clocked in fairly fast speeds for 4G around 10mbps. Circles.Life‘s 4G speeds are dismal at around 2mbps though.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"TLDR: lies upon lies by customer service, porting is a terrible experience and I have not been ported yet even. excuses of ASAP / 24h / 24-48h given, not sure if they have a concept of time.

I’m utterly baffled at the customer service and how ‘ease of porting’ is promoted by this company.

It all started on 26 Jan when I tried porting my line from M1.

I was unpleasantly welcomed by multiple failures due to ‘Please upload front and back copy of NRIC’
(I am porting a number that isn’t under me, to my nric through Circles.Life)

After 4 unsuccessful attempts, I contacted their Customer Service Chat.

On 27th Jan, approx 8am. 1 agent told me that I needed a ‘documentation from donor telco giving green light to port’.

I called M1 and they said they are unable to provide such document as they mentioned that the telco just needs to attempt the porting, which was not done according to M1’s records

I then contacted Circles again about this and was promised by another agent, within 24h for manual porting process.

That night, 27 Jan, I contacted them again as I felt off and another agent told me that a Subject Matter Expert will contact me within 24h - 48h.

29 Jan, 49 hours later, I spoke to the same agent and asked many questions as to why I have yet to receive a call and was being made empty promises, she was unable / refused to answer my enquiries.

I was then promised an urgent call back the next day, 30 Jan, @ 12pm.

That too, did not happen.

I contacted 2 agents asking when I will be receiving the call. Both told me they raised it to be ‘ASAP’.

It’s currently 7 hours after promised time, with 1. my line not ported for 6 days now
2. failures after failures of a problem that I can’t fix on my end
3. lies upon lies provided by their customer service (ASAP, 24h, 48h)
4. not provided with the transcripts of my chat upon request (thankfully screenshots exists)
5. stories that ‘this has been brought up to the backend team’ countless of times
6. no management to handle this matter.

And all this, still being charged for the sim being activated, without having used a single byte of data, second of call, or a single sms.

Circles.Life, is this really how you deal with things?"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 20 Jan 2021,None,"I wanted a fresh start in 2021, so I ditched my contract with Starhub and signed up with a combo plan from Circles. It has been about a month and here's just some of my honest observations: 

[Network]
Riding on the M1 network, I do notice that it's not as great in some areas as when I was with Starhub but I haven't experienced anything too jarring yet. Perhaps they can look into strengthening their network in the Jurong East area especially. 

[Ease of porting]
Transferring my number for the first time, I must admit I was a bit hesitant after seeing some comments about port ins gone awry before but I am happy to report I had no such troubles with Circles and the transfer was done seamlessly within a night. 

[Billing & Customer Service]
The concept of a no contract Combo Plan was really intriguing but the execution and communication of this unorthodox billing method could have been clearer. For example, I don't understand why even as I am paying for my phone via installments the entire amount is blocked off from my credit card? It's identical to having selected the upfront option with the exception that it's deductible every month. This however is a small gripe that I can live with as the agents who assisted me were patient enough to explain the process. 
   
[Mobile App]
Refreshingly simple interface that is clear cut and easy to understand. I see that it also provides a wealth of additional features which I have yet to explore but in general I must say it is very well put together and deserving of the 4.8 stars it has on the app store."

Here is how the chat goes.

Me: Can I know under what conditions will CL terminate my plan
CS: verifying my identity


****Here is the first misguided response****
CS: The grounds to terminate your plan would be 2 months of unpaid bills.

This is obviously wrong coz I am on a 0/month plan, so I corrected him

Me: I don't have any bill, It's 0/Month. So it's forever?
CS: Oh goodness! Thank you for pointing this out. In this case, yes. It would be forever.


I know it's not forever.

****Here is the Second misguided response*****
Me: Even I don't' use it? When I signed up, there were some conditions. But I cannot find it now. Could you please double check?

CS: I'll check again. One moment.
CS: Let me correct myself. If there is no usage on your account for more than 3 months, your line may be terminated.

Me: how do you define no usage?
CS: No usage is defined as no calls/SMS and no data used in given billing cycle.

****He is contradicting himself****
billing cycle is 1 month he just said it's 3 month.

Me: Sending or receiving SMS/call?

******Here is the Third misguided response*****
He corrected himself again.
CS: Let me clarify. our system will send you a message if you haven't purchased a boost within 3 months.

Me: No msg received bro

CS: Let me clarify. Our system will send you a msg if you haven't purchased a boost within 3 months. This will also serve as a warning that your number may be suspended.

*****Here is the 4th misguided response****

If I were to say only one thing about Circles, it would be about their awesome customer service. In the 2+ years I have been with them, I've contacted them with queries about everything from billing to promotions and every single time they've responded promptly with the utmost professionalism I have not seen in other businesses for a long time. 

Sure, more can be done for loyal customers as I've been denied access to certain promos specifically for new customers before but I also see that they have launched similar features for their customers. Now I get monthly rewards from their quest update and they recently upgraded my waiver so that I enjoy $18 forever. I think any other telco would be hard pressed to do that since such a move will surely impact their revenue but Circles has always been an unconventional brand that never played by the rules since the very start. 

It's this very attitude that sets them apart and is why I see myself sticking with them for a long time. All these other new MVNOs that are popping up owe their success to Circles who led the charge with its larger than life data plans at affordable prices."

Super fast and responsive customer service. I could say their customer service is one of the best among all the telco. They are consistent and easy to reach. They deliver their promise most of the time.

[Ease of porting]
The porting processes can be a bit complicated sometime. In case of the first porting was failed, it can be complicated to try to resubmit the request through their app.

[Mobile App]
Too many information in the app makes the app seems messy. Can we log in the service portal by browser? What I know is cannot. If I were right, it's not so user-friendly. Hopefully the layout in the app could be improved, and hope they can implement a web portal allow us to log in by browser too.

[Billing]
I couldn't say they offer the best value since they are other competitors offer even better choices. But they are definitely worth the value with their customer service quality.
One thing to take note is they do not offer free incoming call at most of the plans. It takes $2/month to get free incoming call. Their base plan will be $28 after one year.
During the initial signup, they sincerely want your business and willing to provide more attractive offer depends on how to negotiate with them. This could be complicated if you didn't manage the signup well.
Personally, I don't like this kind of gimmick since it could lead to ""double standard"" sometime."

Their customer service is also out of this world with actual people to help instead of chat bots that just tell you to hold on the line for hours and hours. 

The only downside I guess would be the lack of loyalty rewards apart from the odd bill-waiver every now and again. I think there's been attempts at giving more to customers but there's much to improve on.

Always a breeze, no issues when porting from other telco to Circles.Life. They will constantly update any progress made via SMS to inform you when the change is taking place (usually at late night) so that you can avoid using the phone during the port over.

They are very responsive! I love the change in having an awesome team of Customer support - I ported over mainly because my previous telco was very difficult to reach when I had questions on bill-related matters.

[Needs Oriented]
Having a job that sometimes needing to contact many clients in some months of the year, I like Circles.Life pricing policy and flexibility to tweak/upgrade your plan based on your usage of the month.

I also constantly travel to different parts of the world for work and
often times, I only need a small bit of data or 2-3 overseas calls when I am roaming overseas, and C.L overseas charges linked to their partner telcos are definitely more sensibly priced compared with other more established telcos which stick to their high roaming prices and $10 subscriptions even if you are not travelling."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 25 Jun 2020,Purchased,"Worst Telco ever. Best Cheater. I could give them 0 star review if possible, 1 star is still too generous for them. 

Original plan cost on $38, Charged $14 for your sim card without letting you know. Charged another $20(x2) for unlimited data pack (plus option), without you knowing for two months, both this month and next month, it is switch on automatically in the app. Charged $28 for pro-rated next month bill. Ended up my first month bill is $82.

Moreover, the network speed is too slow, download speed is averagely 4mbps, and less than 1mbps for uploading speed. Most of the time, I can't even browse Facebook, Instagram, and cannot receive whatsapp messages.

Even after contacting the Customer service team, their typical reply is that they will solve the issue for you and they try to dismiss you by sharing articles in their help section of their web-page. 

I even suspect they copy paste this line in every of their reply: ""We're sorry for the inconvenience that this has been causing you. Not to worry, we all gathered all the information you provided and forwarded them to our Network Team for further investigation. Rest assured that we'll update you the soonest we receive a response from them. Thanks again for the kindest patience.""

They are sending this without giving actual help. Network issue is not solved after escalated to the network team, refund issue is not settle after they have send in the refund request and they blame your bank for not giving you refund, nonsense.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 05 Jun 2020,Purchased,"Just a heads up.

If you ever want to port out of Circles.Life, please do NOT do so at the end of the month.

On 29th May 2020, I applied for a new SIM card from another telco. However, I was unaware that it would take 3-4 days to process the transition. So I thought it should be fine, Circles.Life would just charge me based on what I've used.

WRONG. 

I have successfully ported out of Circles.Life on 2nd June 2020 but Circles.Life still billed me the FULL price for the new month. Unlike the other telcos who will just prorate your usage, they have this T&C:

"" In the event the Customer terminates the Services or ports out before the end of a monthly Billing Cycle, the Customer will be obligated to pay the applicable charges for the remainder of the Billing Cycle.""

I've only used 100MB between 29th May 2020 - 2nd June 2020. 

I seeked help from the Circles.Life LiveChat, hoping they would be kind enough to reverse the charges. After consulting their team, their Customer Happiness Expert concluded that it was not possible. Basically, they just kept highlighting that particular clause back to me to deny my request. I requested for them to only charge me for the 100MB, but it got rejected too. 

Lesson learnt: Don't just skip through all the T&Cs, assuming that the terms would be the same everywhere. This assumption may bind you into a predicament you don't want to be in should you want to get out.

It was my mistake for not reading them and now I have to pay for it, literally."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Apr 2020,Purchased,"A bit of background, I ported over to Circles last November from Giga, due to the 11.11 promo, and have ported back to my previous telco. Had a mostly negative experience with Circles, and maybe some might say that's what I get for just $7/month.


[Network]

Network was really dissatisfactory for me. Connectivity was way worse compared to my previous telco. This was the main reason why i decided to port over after the 6 months promo of unlimited calls were up. I travel the Green and Red line daily, and connectivity was okay for me when using my previous telco, no connectivity issue at all (surprisingly). But when I switched to Circles, it was tough to even finish a game without losing connection multiple times. Even when i am at home, and i stay somewhere where there aren't any tall buildings blocking or whatever, there are times when connection just disappears. 


[Ease of porting] and [Customer Service]

I have mixed feelings with the porting, because when I ported TO Circles, everything went smoothly. No disruptions etc, the night it ported, the next morning it's as if nothing happened.
HOWEVER! The porting OUT was a nightmare. When I received my new telco's SIM and activated it, I received an email saying Circles had rejected the porting due to an inactive number? I was still using my number at that time! So I went to use the Circles live chat to enquire, and they told me everything is fine on their side, and mentioned that I should check with my new telco. Which I did, and the new telco told me that their side was fine as well, and it was Circles which had rejected their port-in request. So I went back to Circles, who insisted that their system was A-OK. I went back and forth quite a bit, and in total spoke to 4 Circles staff and 3 Giga's staff. In the end Giga showed me the message they received from Circles, showing that they had rejected it, claiming that my number was inactive. Circles then mentioned they would escalate this issue to their technical side, saying that they would drop me an email by the end of the day. I waited for an update, and only received an email from them at 9pm-ish, asking me to confirm my name and NRIC for their further review. After a whole day, THEN you ask for my details? I thought they would have it since I was using THEIR app to chat. Maybe its a process or a statutory requirement or something, i'm not sure. The next day, no reply still. So i chatted with them again in the afternoon, and they mentioned that the porting will take place that night (finally). So I then asked what the issue wasin the end, and the staff replied saying that upon checking, the issue was not at their end, so I guess it meant it was the new telco's issue, and ended the chat. About an hour later, I received an email from one of the Circles staff I chatted with the previous day, apologising as they found out that the issue was on their end. 
So this is one big reason why I am not satisfied with Circles. Maybe its a one-off issue and suey suey i kena, but I would have expected the staff to have thoroughly checked before saying that the issue wasnt at their end. I honestly do not know what happens behind the scenes since its the Covid period and perhaps its a mess as well for them. But from the customer's side, it really was an unpleasant last experience with them.


[Billing]
Another point was also the billing. Maybe not so much billing per se, but the adjustments and discounts that i should have received from the 11.11 promo. The way that they billed me previously was they charged me the full bill, before adjusting it out in my next bill. And that was AFTER i wrote in to them, which they replied it was a system issue. Even the free unlimited calls for 6 months required a write in to waive it. Everything had to be initiated by me, even when it was a benefit that shouldve been given by them. If i recall this issue was then fixed a few billing cycles later (maybe 4th?).

Other than these issues, daily experience was alright, just a normal telco like any other in my opinion. But i might be a little biased after that experience, so do take my words with a pinch of salt 😂"

Reviewing here because no one at Circles Life can't be bothered about an ""old"" customer or understand the issues I have raised. 

I was one of the earliest customers when they started off, 3 years I believe? They did a good job from being the first mover and great customer service to the ease of use of app (still is the leading one).

As of late last year, I noticed that when I was happily paying $30 (including $2 free incoming) monthly which I was happy to do that, but the news of new customers that came onboard was only paying $18 per month for the same package did put me off a fair bit. Guess ""first-movers"" shouldn't be rewarded?

I must be fair that from early this year till now, though they gave me a 3 month discount of $10 (when other new customers are on $18 forever?), I have not heard from them after much discussions via email (which proves to be really bad) with customer service officers not understanding myself, or email bots used? The promise was to revert after 3 months, but... maybe because of the COVID-19 situation, they have been quite busy.

I actually asked them if I should change to another provider before going porting back again in order to enjoy $18/mth package! Overall... very disappointed and I guess loyalty don't pay and perhaps they are waiting for another player to disrupt them."

I tried to port in twice! submit my documents to port in circles. Circles claim my number with my previous telco is suspended. They request me to do re-submit.  Submitted again/ Failed again.

Echoing the previous review. There is a huge lack of transparency in the way the first bill is handled. The 1st month is pro-rated at $28 month rather than $18 month which I thought I had signed up for. So effectively, you will be paying $28 for the first month and $18 for the next 12 months.

I have tried contacting customer service and they were not helpful at all in resolving and clarifying this.

Future people who are considering to port over please be aware of this extra charge. Circles Life markets its plan as $18 a month but omits the fact that the 1st month is billed differently from what is being advertised."

The network rides on the M1 network but so far I have no problems with the signal except when you are taking the train underground. Prior to porting, I've made some enquiries around with friends using M1 and they all mentioned no issues with the line above ground.

[Customer Service]
I had my fair share of unpleasant service from Singtel and with the recent 'upgrade' from customer service hotline to a robo-service hotline, it was the last straw for me. Circles life, however, was exceptional because it has been a while since I am able to reach customer service personnel without waiting/holding on the line for 30-45 mins only to have the personnel telling me something which i could have done on my own. I love it when they adopt the live-chat session as well as the recorded conversation so that neither one can deny whatever that is being said.

Porting over was very easy and I am pleased with it. The ability to retain my number helped saved me tons of hassle to change and inform my contacts of my new number.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Feb 2020,Purchased,"[Network]
Network is strong and stable most of the times with the exception of some parts of the MRT tunnels and in very rare cases, random but short disconnections. 

[Customer Service]
Excellent, excellent, excellent. I think they have set the gold standard for customer service. 

[Ease of porting]
On Circles' part, it is very easy. It was on Singtel's part that sucked. And amazingly, Circles also waived part of my bill due to me not using their line yet thanks to Singtel's screw up. 

[Mobile App]
Very engaging and easy to use app. All a customer may need can be done on the app. Excellent. 

[Billing]
Again, excellent billing procedure from them. Had a scam call that I did not realized once and was charged about $80 for the call. But they waived part of it after I raised it to them. At least it took some of the pain away. "

[Network]
Signing up with the promotions is quite worth it. I got 6 months of unlimited data when I first signed up with the promotion.

Network is pretty good and stable. Occasionally it will be slow on the train especially when it is crowded but not disruptive. 

The mobile app is very user friendly and allows you to buy add ons and view your bill easily. You can also start a live chat with customer service quite seamlessly. "

Ported over from my Singtel contract. Port over was fuss free. Applied for the SIM and got it delivered to my office the next day. However, port over was only done the day after at 12am so I had to wait another day before I got to use it.

[Network]
Network is generally okay but reception is not as good undergorund especially at the circle "
Level 9. God of Wisdom,Updated on 29 Jan 2020,Purchased,"Writing it as a review of a user of the $18 for 20GB SIM only plan

[Summary]

Best value as SIM only plan for users of 5-20GB usage per month

[Network- 4.5/5]

Because of my job i have been fortunate (or unfortunate) that I need to travel to the furthest flung of Singapore to work. That's why I have found weak spots where reception of Circles Life is poor and you need to move a few metres to get reception- places such as Tuas Checkpoint, forests of Sungei Gudong near Malaysian waters etc. However, outside of these areas, reception of Cirlces Life is relatively good. So definitely not a 5/5, but a 4.5/5

[Ease of porting- 5/5]

Porting Process was easy and I ported over without a hitch. Just needed to fill our my particulars and Circles Life did the rest of the work!

[Mobile App]

The mobile app was intuitive by design. It shows how much data/minutes you have used for your monthly plan clearly and is presented neatly.

[Customer Service- 5/5]

As one who doesn't like to waste time on small matters, the prospects of needing to call and keeping my ears glued to the number is not one of my favourite. Circles Life has a good customer service interface on its app where you canc hat with a customer service assistant. I used it and am happy that it is responsive, able to type easily and waiting is not a hassle. 

[Bill payment]

I pay via credit card (GPMC), my favourite method because of its rebates. Not going to rate this

[My recommendation]

As someone who used 7GB in data monthly (about the average user of Singapore), Circles life is probably the best SIM only for this range of (5-20 GB monthly usage). It comes with free caller ID as well and adequate free call minutes.  However, if you are constantly working at far flung places, I would advise not to get Circles Life but instead opt for Singtel for better reception. It will cost you $2 more per month but for better reception in ulu area. Otherwise, for 99% of other areas in Singapore, Circles Life is my recommended SIM only plan!"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 27 Jan 2020,Purchased,"[Network]

For the most part, network was pretty stable with the exception of certain areas like Seletar. No issues even in the underground MRT stations.

[Ease of porting]

As I was porting over from a corporate account, my name was indicated in a certain way and there was some difficulty as the porting process required me to indicate exactly as it was. 

[Customer Service]

That was where the customer service was helpful in resolving the error in my submission.This was done via the messaging app and it was a  smooth process.

[Mobile App]

The mobile app was intuitive and gave me the ability to add add ons as needed. The cherry on the top was that the data used is easy to see on the app as well.

[Billing]

Billing was fuss free. 

In short , all round great experience."

Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 26 Nov 2019,None,Changed from Singtel and no regrets. Customer service (in-app chat) is prompt. The porting was smooth and fuss-free. The app is user-friendly and easy to use. 
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 24 Nov 2019,Purchased,"Took the advice of the peeps here and went with Circles.Life after doing much research.

Firstly, I had the port-in promo. The porting in process was absolutely seamless. My number was originally not under my own name, so using GOMO or Giga, I had to manually do the number transfer. Moreover, I called Starhub and they said I had to go down to the shop personally with the account holder, pay a $20 transfer. Circles.Life had none of these, they simply had me key in the account holder's IC number, sign, and did the rest for me. Voila.

Connection wise is fairly stable, although it was truly that in certain MRT stations it does get cut. But then again, it's not like the other telcos have perfect connection underground either. 

App is clean, super easy to use. Data roaming is cheaper (and makes much more sense) than GOMO. Customer service was insanely good, they even replied my email on a weekend within 2 hours.

While my contract will revert to the original price of $28 after 12 months, I will see if it makes sense to stick with Circles.Life by then.

Hope this helps."

Pros of Circles: 
- Good customer service from Circles, smaller companies ca actually do a better service job. You can imagine calling Singtel countless times and getting no response that you have to visit their help centre and only to find out its a waste of time lining up. 
- Cheap roaming: Within asian countries and their app easily allows me to activate in minutes
- Customisable plans: More data and calls, no sms needed
- Earn more data through games or just remaining loyal to circles 

Cons: 
- Other telco providers may have more attractive phone bundles with contract, only if you're thinking of getting a new phone"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 21 Aug 2019,None,"Pros: 
- Value wise I think Circles.Life really has the best deal.
- Connection: No issues so far. In fact, I used to be on Singtel but the connection on Circles.Life has been better than Singtel ever has for me.
- Customer service is great! Very quick and friendly replies.
- Porting from Singtel to Circles.Life was fuss-free, no need to physically visit a store. The SIM card gets delivered to you and activates shortly after your connection with the old telco is cut.

Cons:
- New customers get the better end of the deal. I'm paying $28/month (which is actually reasonable) for the 20GB plan (everyone gets 20GB now) but the new users only pay $18/month for 20GB as well?!?!? Doesn't help that I still see their ads ALL the time — thanks Circles.Life, just rub it in.

- there's no way to port your number out from Circle.Life so, essentially, you're stuck for LIFE if you want to keep your number — do correct me if I'm wrong, I'd be happy to be proven otherwise. Not that I'm looking to change telcos but it's nice to have that option if I ever need to."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 21 Aug 2019,None,"Circles.Life is ridiculously good it doesn't make sense to not use it:

- Ridiculously easy and straightforward sign-up. There's no need to go to the customer service centre, press the ticket machine, sit there and wait for your queue number to be called, talk to the customer service officer who sometimes irresponsibly upsells you. All the options are displayed clearly online. What you see is what you get and the SIM card can be collected/delivered at your convenience.

- Monthly billing is hassle-free with automatic deduction option and email notification.

- Customer service is great. I had a roaming problem overseas and the customer service HUMAN actually answered me and solved my problem within a day. There's no need to listen to the pre-recorded customer service voice and press numbers or chat to a non-understanding bot. 

- Finally, most importantly, the recent additional free 20 GB per month for $28 is too good to be true but it's true.

- The only downside is that the infrastructure is that of M1 which does not have the best coverage in Singapore but it is not that big a deal.

Network Connection: There's no perfect Telco Provider. So there were times when the data reception is quite bad. But it never lasts for long. It would also prolly be because of the area, which is common to telcos.

Customer Service: They don't have a contact # to call in case you want to ring them for an enquiry, issue etc.. Instead, they have a live chat. Though again, there's no perfect telco provider, so I've already experienced shady officers which the good thing about CirclesLife is that, they will get back to you to sort things out when they feel thay you're not happy with the outcome of your concern.

I had plenty of questions towards the fees and policies but he could explain each part in clear details + examples. So kudos in that, didn't have to get confused further.
Probably the downside would be the lack in call centre which would have save a lot of time since talking could just get things clear within minutes, rather than chatting through app/email which could take hours or even days for each other to reply at different timings.

Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,"I was an early adopter of $0/mth Flexi-Plan in June 2018. This plan has 1GB data, 30 minutes talktime, 10 SMS, free caller ID. Though no overseas roaming service available. Those who are frequent travellers would need to take note. 

Signup can only be done on Circlelife website as there is no retail or agent stores. 

Signing up on their website was quite simple. Just create a new Circlelife account with personal particulars, choose $0/mth Flexi Plan, upload my digital copy of NRIC and lastly fill in a Credit Card number. Delivery of SIM card by courier cost $6, there was no self-collection site. 

Porting from other telcos is available during signup and there is an option to port at a later stage after activation. I choose not to port over first as I wanted to try on their network before deciding. 

Received my Circlelife SIM card within a week, pop in the SIM card into my mobile phone and was immediately activated ready to use. 

I could download the Circlelife app to check on data, talktime, SMS usage for the month and to boost/topup my data or talktime at a cost if I ever need to. I could also do a port in from other telco, on this line, at some other time with the app itself. This is great flexibility!

Also, the app has a online Live Chat function with their customer serivce staff when I have an enquiry. The Live Chat does not respond immediately when activated, there will still be some minutes of waiting time before someone respond to my enquiry. 

Reception wise for 4G network is good at outdoor and indoor buildings as Circlelife piggy bank on M1 network. There was fast data connection speed outdoor and no drop call connections ever experience before.

However, whenever I was in a moving train along North East MRT, especially Kovan to Serangoon, 4G data reception and 4G data speed in was non-existence. This still happening in 2019.  I would need to manually switched to 3G on my mobile phone to get a usable data connection. 

I have already used this Flexi-Plan on my spare phone for more than 12 months and Circlelife is still continuing this $0/mth plan with no changes in plan price yet. According to the Circlelife's customer service staff on livechat, as long I have usage on this line, either data or talktime in the last 3 months, this line will not be suspended or terminated. 

Overall, other than the non-existence 4G data network along some North East MRT line, which was bearable as I don't commute that line often. I would recommend this Flexi-Plan to any low data/talktime usage users, such as the elderly or for usage in a spare phone or tablet. "

10/10 highly recommend! "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Connection: 4.5/5 
No major issues at all. Have another SIM with another telco and Circles is actually better. 

Price: 5/5
Bill for the past 3 months: 
May: $34.88
Jun: $39.28
Jul: $29.84
(With my previous telco, $80++/month was a norm) 

Customer Service: 4.5/5 
Simple request for assistance on their app gets immediate response. No long waiting on the line. 

Roaming: 5/5 
Cheap Plans at just $5 for 1 GB to neighbouring countries like Malaysia, Indonesia etc. 
Save the hassle of buying SIM card when arriving at that country. 
Just activate on your App. 
I actually had a problem with this when I was in Indonesia a few months back, where they didn't activate the Boost I bought, a few text to customer service on their app and my refund was done almost immediately. 


A few additional benefits to take note: 
- FREE unlimited whatsapp 
- Top up just $2 per month to get unlimited incoming. Just did this and you can see my bill for Jul is already lower by $5-$10 
- LOADS of data to use no no worries about that

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Of the most seamless and easy telco in terms of signing up. One can get going in less than 15 minutes - a fantastic feat compared to the long waiting times of the traditional players. As the networks rides on M1’s infrastructure - reliability and speed isn’t an issue. As for customer service, the mobile app covers most of the bases, and personally, this is a major plus point for me. In this day and age where time is a premium, finding the time to visit a telco outlet is almost impossible. And this is where Circles.Life have done well by bringing the customer service to their customers instead of the traditional model, and saving them operating  costs on which they pass the savings to their customers in the form of generous data allocations. I’m happy with Circles.Life and for those who have their hesitations, I’d recommend them to try the $0 plan to see what a spectacular ride they’re in for with Circles.Life! "

I actually applied through a roadshow instead of the usual online application. The process from start to finish took only about 10 minutes and the employee handling the sign up process was friendly and helped me fill in everything and handed me the sim card after everything was done

CONNECTION
I travel on the green line daily and never had problem streaming videos and other applications. 

PRICE 
I can't say much about the price compared to other telcos as I'm an expat and this is my first choice as telco provider. Overall compared to my native country, 28 SGD for 20GB per month is very cheap and you get 50mb free if you pair the app with your ezlink card for every 10 trips taken. It's not much but it's nice to get extra data

CUSTOMER SERVICE
I've had to email the customer service a couple of times due to some typo in my bill.

They upgraded my plan recently for free,can never be thankful enough. I am already pretty satisfied with their existing plan prior upgrading don't get me wrong. 
Although I still receive ton of the new marketing emails which I felt was more for potential users than existing cause I ported in already. Lol
Tbh their network used to be quite unstable, always heard that m1 network isn't as good.
But now i managed to see some improvement in their network within Singapore. But, Ulu places like tekong might need a little improvement. (feedback from friend in army)

They also reward their customers with 500 MB bonus data for every 6 months that you stay with them. In addition, they have been giving bonus data through daily polls and on special occasions.

The downside is that their basic plan does not include SMSes, so you get charged for every SMS sent. Also, the 100 mins talktime is for both incoming and outgoing calls."

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,they have changed the mobile market ever since they have come on board.  Excellent customer service and extremely responsive.  It is good that they are listening and making inroads to win users over.  I am 20 months into circles and have no complaints at all.  Excellent overall connectivity from wherever I am.  
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I was a little sceptical when Circles.Life first came out. More data with cheaper monthly bill? Sounds too good to be true to me. So I waited another year to observe this virtual telco before making the switch from SingTel. Even then, I was nervous about hidden costs, slow data, or poor customer services. 

How wrong was I! Circles has been very transparent with their costing and billing. Registration of $38 ($20 discount if signed up in roadshows which I highly recommend over using your friends’ promo code as you get free data from roadshow too), $28 base monthly bill, and any other add ons you choose to add. 

Data speed is decent, though it can get slightly slower in underground train travels and further away from main city (eg Pulau Tekong where I serve my NS). With the amount of bonus data I have, there’s very few times I worry about exceeding my monthly usage. Of course, that’s because I don’t watch videos on my phone. 

Circles created a Facebook group for users to voice out their technical issues and suggestions for the relatively new telco it is. I am impressed at this very gesture as it shows that they do care about their users and strive to provide the best. I recall scrolling through the group and saw suggestions such as whatsapp passport and unlimited data. A few weeks later, whatsapp passport is available at $1 a day and unlimited data on demand is available at $3 a day. Not only are these add ons cheap, the Circles team also listened and implemented our suggestions promptly. 

There’s no doubt that I am thoroughly satisfied with Circles.Life for their wonderful telco service. Kudos to Circles!"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,"I've recently hit my first 6 month mark with circles life, which means I've just had my first 500mb bonus added to my account. I've never been happier with my Telco. 

Plus points:
- Unlimited whatsapp, which means unlimited whatsapp calls. Ive recently removed the free incoming option calls because with the ability to make free WhatsApp calls, I find myself using less than 20 minutes talk time a month. 
- Excellent value (especially with the 500mb loyalty bonus that got added recently). I've not had a phone bill more than $30.25 even when I had the free incoming add on.
- Customer service: the in app chat feature is brilliant. Instant answers to queries without being put on hold.

Cons:
- roaming costs are expensive. But the recently introduced unlimited WhatsApp add on (for use while roaming) would go a long way if it works as described. Have yet to try it out.

All in all, it's been a great ride with circles life. I signed up for a separate Zero1 line earlier this month because I got tempted by their ""$19 per month"" proposition, but I've only been deeply disappointed by them so far. In spite of my being billed, I have after three weeks still no news of a projected delivery date, and their customer service (which is only reachable by email) is abysmal. Slow and non helpful replies! I plan on cancelling the zero1 line at the first available opportunity"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,"I've been a customer of Circle.Life for 1 year and 3 months now! Here are some of the things I like and dislike about it:

Connectivity: For most part of Singapore it's ok, except during a couple of occasions I've had connectivity issues while in a mall or underground (MRT) whereas my SingTel/M1 friends did not."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"Before:
I was a Singtel customer since my dad got me the line when I was 15 so that's about 20 years. The push factor was that I never, EVER felt like I was being treated like a loyal customer. In fact, I've had too many instances where they were just plain low balling me (e.g. Birthday treats can't be redeemed, mysterious charges on the bill). But it wasn't easy leaving a long-term relationship no matter how detrimental it might be. Plus, I was a singtel circle member so I got free data on Sundays.

The pitch:
Then Circles.Life dropped in and offered my company a Corp package. Pretty attractive package with quite a lot of data: 27gb a month.

Coming from a 3GB plan where I had to religiously watch every drop of data consumed,  this was a windfall. But that's not the determining factor.

So I dropped hints on Facebook I was planning to switch and wanted advice from my friends and I also tagged singtel and Circles.Life.

Guess which telco replied? They didn't even have to convince or pitch to me. They just said hi and told me I can contact them for further details.

So all the other considerations about connectivity, reliability, cost comparisons, value, etc. faded into the background because really, for a telco or any organisation to reach out to their customers so readily and easily, that's nothing to be sniffed at. I would know because my 2 jobs have been at organisations that are customer focused. And it makes a world of difference to know the organisation I'm paying for the service, gives enough of a damn to want to talk to me. Or at the very least, gives enough of a damn to spend money to hire people to talk to their customers. Too many other organisations pay lip service to putting their customers first and how they're ""making everyday better"". Who's day exactly? 

That open line of communication is priceless in today's hyper saturated market.

Consideration:
Of course, as a consumer, I'm price sensitive so I will never say never to changing and Circles.Life has set a pretty high bar for service standards which I hope they can live up to as they scale up. But from what I've seen so far, nobody else comes close as a total package. 

Pros:
-Top class customer engagement
-clear and easy to manage plans 
the proof of the pudding is in the eating. When others sort to obfuscate by piling all sorts of nonsensical and unnecessary additions into your mobile plan (SMS-es?! Really?! Even illegal money lenders have moved onto WhatsApp.), the simplicity of being able to customise your plan, giving you control over what you really want, is gold dust to consumers.

- good enough connectivity
I can't say for sure that connectivity is awesome because I'm well aware that Circles.Life is riding on M1's infrastructure which doesn't exactly make one feel like you're walking on sunshine TBH. But as a trade off for the other perks n liberties you get, it is well worth it.

Cons:
- connectivity (see above)
- no exclusive deals for phones
- smaller group of merchant partners
This point isn't much of a problem for me because I'm stuffed to the gills with all sorts of cards and memberships that I don't even use. So really, if merchant deals are a tiebreaker for you in choosing a telco, I'd advise you to reconsider your (Circles) life choices.

Have a good one y'all! Hit me up if you need more advice in your consideration process. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"Absolutely an advocate of Circles Life.

Circles Life has got to be the most value-added telco service. These are the few reasons why:

1) They are generous with their data! I live for data, and they understand customers like us (hahaha)
2) Great customer service. They could answer my questions so quickly, and settle my concerns. I like that they are so easy to reach.
3) Speedy rectification of problems. When I first signed up, I was told I would be getting 3 months of data, whereas the fine print was ""even if the contract starts on the last day of the month, it is counted as a month"". They responded to my request and extended that additional month of free 20GB. 
4) Great IT infrastructure. Bills are sent electronically, can be seen on the app as well as in the emails. Everything is simple to use!
5) My mother had trouble typing English, and wow they could even respond in Chinese to her. I think it's really cool.
6) Cost is low, and very worthy. Converted my mother, and now going to convert the rest of my family too (Good things must share!)

Cons:
- sometimes when we want to reach their customer service rep through the app, they dont respond immediately and I dont like to wait with the app on. So by the time I came back to the app after scrolling somewhere else, the conversation was closed by the rep. Can be better managed!
- Could come up with Chinese setting for the app instead. My mother had trouble understanding some of the English.
- Really poor connection in some areas (especially entire purple line).

Overall two thumbs up!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"I have been using Circles for more than a year now and overall pretty happy with the service.

Pros :
1. Just simply love the amount of customisation options available through their Circles Care App -  No more waiting to get through to customer service over a call 😀. There is even an option to chat with customer service through the app in case a need arises. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"Switching from SingTel to Circles Life, my life in the north south line trains got much better because I no longer suffer SingTel’s coverage dead zone.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"I had done my tour of duty with the three telcos & thought I would stay with green until Circles came along. Great, fast and effective customer service along with value for money plans that gave me what I needed (and not rubbish I don need like 300 mins talk time) ensures that Circles is the one for me. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"My Story: Been using Circles.life since August 2016 when they were holding their NDP promotion. Circles.life has been a life changer for me after breaking my 1 year contract with my previous telco, because even paying the cancellation fee was worth it.

For once, I went from having 3 gb to 6 gb immediately with Circles.Life, while dropping $20 from my monthly bill. Following that, I have been getting free data from various promotions and referrals. There's even a point where I had about 50+ GB for free that month, while paying only $28. Currently running at 16.1 GB and paying the base price of $28 still.

Comparison:
Below is a comparison of why you should and should not move to Circles.life. I'm not even going to list prices as a main factor because it's quite irrelevant to my review.

PROS:
1. Short customer service waiting time - If you have a problem with anything, the live chat can get you sorted out. Plus, it takes less than 5 minutes (usually instant) to reach support. Out of 10 problems, 9 times were resolved instantly for me. The other one time took 2 hours as they had to settle something back end.
2. Facing problems - Data outage and can't access your internet? Circles.Life compensates its users every time there is a hiccup, giving free data once.
3. Great experiences - For one, they held an event at a nightclub for users. I was invited to it and the event was pretty amazing, and even giving out free swag and data to attendees.
4. Loyalty pays off - A lot of reviews tend to not mention this but you'll get 500 MB every 6 months up to 2 GB.
5. Be at the front of the pack - Circles.life kicked off a lot of changes, remember seeing data prices drastically drop once Circles.life launched the 20 for $20? They recently launched a $3 unlimited plan per day at time of writing this review.
6. Community - There's a 'inner circle' that you can join if you're a member, and there's monthly meetings that is held at the moment for its members. Activities ranging from meals, board games, and even hanging out at Circles.Life office and know the team!

CONS:
1. Data roaming - Circles.Life hasn't really tackled data roaming and stuff like M1 Data passport is still better if you're a frequent traveller. There's some small steps towards this such as the $1/day whatsapp for overseas
2. Dual sim - There's no such feature where you can have 2 members sharing the same pool of data, talk time, and sms. if you're on such a plan, Circles.Life is definitely not for you.
3. No Physical Shops - Being a digital telco, they don't have any physical shops at all if you want to talk to a live person. However, they hold roadshows from time to time at various parts of Singapore.
4. Data 'dead' spots - There's reports of certain parts of Singapore where data doesn't exist, for example parts of North East Line faces this problem.

It's hard not to be biased, but I tried my best to make this review as unbiased as possible. It's also a compilation of my entire Circles.life experience since when I joined, and they definitely deliver an experience that is unbeatable by the main 3 telcos."

All in all, their plans are great. Have been with their broadband for many years as well and is satisfied with its performance so far.

But their customer service and customer-centricity in that respect is pretty bad. Just pray nothing goes wrong, if it does, don't count on customer service doing you any good.

Generally happy with the plan itself, good emphasis on the data, light on the SMSes and call time - which is more suitable for current daily usage.

[Customer Service] [Ease of porting]
Customer support and port-in was a terrible experience for me.
Tried to sign up (and port-in) from about mid-Dec, but was rejected due to technical issue on MR's side. Nonetheless, they do not care to update me when the issue was resolved, nor did they actually publish information about this technical issue anywhere on their publicity. It was a very one-sided effort from me as a customer from mid-Dec to almost mid-Jan, with a few trips to malls (fighting queues to get in) to inquire about the status myself. I wrote in to their customer service after my second rejection on 4th Jan but only received a reply on 11th Jan after my issue was resolved by myself. In their email, they were just being casually and insincerely apologetic.

Please learn to be more forthcoming and take the initiative to reach out to your customers, especially when things go south.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 06 Dec 2020,None,"When you guys just started up, My first service was a broadband line with you guys, for 2 years, I NEVER had to call the customer service line, I NEVER had to go through any service disruption, basically for 2 years, I just pay my bills on time. When my contract expired, I took another 2 years with you guys. I also ported my personal mobile line, my parents line to you guys. Same thing, NEVER had to call the customer service line and etc and even though there was one bad mobile service disruption. You guys handled it well, but announcing and did your best to restore the service.

Moving on, this is the ""not so pleasant"" experience, earlier this year, my credit card was hacked and as a result I had cancel my card. The extremely tedious part of keying in the new credit card details for each and every line/service I had was crazy. Unfortunately one of the lines was terminated by me earlier,and there was an outstanding bill of $7x, as the line was cancelled, there was no way for me to see the outstanding on my app (Or maybe I wasn't aware how to),  months pass by and one day I received a letter of demand for the $7x.. I immediately checked the app and again, it reflected that all the bills were paid on time. 

Puzzled I called in to enquire and I was advised that I had that outstanding. (Arranged to pay it immediately) Naturally I was displeased and told your staff that I never received any overdue payment, no phone calls and no way I could see the overdue payment on the app. In short I was in the dark, requested for a call back and a nice lady Joanna called me, so I shared my feedback with her and she took it in good stride. 

Months pass by, and recently I wanted to port over my personal line and sign up another broadband for my own place but I was told I didn't qualify because of a bad credit with your company. Puzzled I asked for a call back and I was informed due to the earlier incident this year. My credit rating was bad and in short was blacklisted in your company. Long story short, 2 calls and finally managed to speak n explain to Joanna again, she mentioned she would do her best to assist. (Joanna is an asset to your company). 

In closing, I believe that for a company to improve, they have to be willing to listen to reasonable feedback and to work on it and improve. Apparently for my case, the constructive feedback which I've provided wasn't act upon, worst still, I was being blacklisted, due to the fact that there might be a loophole in your system and that puzzles me. I sincerely hope you guys can work on improving because as consumers we deserve better and you shld be better. Sending a letter of demand to a customer without any prior communications isn't constructive. Pls look into this."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 07 Jul 2020,Purchased,"I came from the $8 RedOne plan and decided to port-in to MyRepublic $10 Lite plan late last month in preparation for my final year of overseas study in Europe. Therefore, having large local mobile data is not the biggest factor for my decision to transfer to this network but the promise of minimal charge for overseas calling through the MyRepublic Talk app. 

Back when I was in Singtel telco 2 years ago, local and international telemarketers kept calling my number overseas which at one time my billing reaches to 3 digits. Last year, I ported-in to RedOne and the frequency of telemarketers calling dropped significantly (now I think some telcos probably sell our personal data to telemarketers when we are overseas to earn more money through international call billings). Even so, the charges for roaming calls and data under RedOne is very expensive if it really happens so I transferred to MyRepublic as they have now the $10 Lite plan which was not available in offer last year.

I ported in the MyRepublic outlet in Hillion Mall and the service was excellent and the process was very fast. Got my new sim card immediately and on early morning the next day, I can already use all the features. Online  customer service did reply my inquiries but not as fast from RedOne which has a dedicated Whatsapp CS agent.

I dont have any major problems with the internet connection because MyRepublic has better reception in some parts of my house which my home wifi and RedOne has difficulty to connect. However, I decided to turned off the Volte on this sim because I could not receive or do calls locally when it is activated. 

Anyway, since the time MyRepublic lost its bid as the 4th telco, it literally lost its mojo because their mobile plan offer is not as much as different with other MVNO or the incumbent ones anymore beside from TPG which has now become the market disrupter. If TPG Singapore could not survive due to the intense competition and being split away from Australia, I hope MyRepublic could take TPG over."

The network is pretty stable and I am almost always getting good speeds save for a couple of occasions where I have to restart the network. But no major issues with speed and video streaming so far. This includes underground tunnels.
Even as you run out of your Full Speed package, data speeds are reasonable and good enough for low resolution youtube, whatsapp messaging. However, you are unable to do any video calls on whatsapp not playback videos of higher quality.

Mobile App/Billing
One of the most well designed app so far and designed with the user in mind. Useful information like your data usage, talktime is clearly presented. Payments is also possible in app without being redirected to a seperate payment gateway. In addition, you can choose either a one time payment or recurring payment with your credit card. Invoices are delivered digitally and you have no problems retrieving them in app.

Customer Service/ Ease of Porting
Have not spoken/interacted with one yet which is a good thing. Number porting was seamless and sim card was delivered promptly. Unlike other MVNO, Myrepublic doesnt charge a delivery fee. Sim card fees are also waived.

Myrepublic delivers on its promise to give users higher data at competitive prices. Their previous plans were not competitive at all but with the recent announcement of limited time plans, they are back in the competition once again."

The only thing I can deduce is that they suspect a 36 year old woman living in a HDB flat, who has internet access and a credit card to apply for this line, cannot afford to pay $10 a month for a mobile plan.

To give an update, I ported over on Saturday and till today Wednesday (1.42am), my problems were still not solved!!

Issues:
1) Unable to receive phone calls from most telcos (landline etc) 
2) Unable to receive SMS

I clicked “Live Agent” on Monday, waited for a while and there was NO NOTIFICATIONS (I DID SET TO ON) when someone came online. Fine. On Tuesday, I clicked on live agent again and I have my eyes glued on the giga app. Finally after 35 - 40 mins later, live agent replied. Only to tell me that she will bring this issue to the Engineers. After which, NO SOLUTION! Left me hanging with no closure - didn’t even dare to end the conversation.

I was trying to make some payment for my Shopee purchase, but I COULDNT RECEIVE ANY OTP TO EFFECT THE TRANSACTION. I have to resort to borrowing my friend’s credit card to settle this. 

When I call my own number, it still says “the M1 number is not in use” .  What is this!!!!

The mobile app is also terrible and it doesn't always load although it is slightly better now.

Would rate customer support as zero stars if possible. The live agent does not work at all and the support staffs do not reply to their email. I have been contacting them for almost a month now to try to change my credit card on my account but customer service either does not reply or provides responses asking for a screenshot and then completely disappears after I send a screenshot of my error message. I believe I am not the only one facing issues with credit card as my family member is encountering the same issue and I saw reviews on seedly of people mentioning this same error. 

I sent my last follow up email 5 days ago requesting for assistance (their automated replies state that I will receive a reply within 72 hours but I only receive a reply after I send a second follow up email after 72 hours) and have yet to receive a reply from them. I have made it clear that I was absolutely dissatisfied with their terrible service and have made known to them that I will file an official complain to IMDA for this lack of customer support. If it is a problem with manpower, they absolutely should try to hire more support staff given how much they've grown thus far, and if the credit card issue was a technical error, they could at least kindly inform me that they are trying to fix it instead of completely not replying to all the emails I have sent them.

I believe I am not the only one who is unhappy with this lack of customer support from giga and would urge anyone who feels the same to contact me so we can lodge a complain to IMDA together as I believe if I were to do so alone, IMDA would not take it seriously.

1) when is it coming? 
2) will I be charged a reschedule delivery fee since it is not my fault? 

One agent even claimed it was raining so there will be delays -please I've checked the rain map. Spotty rain compared to the thunderstorm we experienced the other day. 

Another agent just kept replying "" we are aware"". AWARE OF WHAT??? I'm not even aware of what s/he is aware of.

throughout this whole time, no one came close to my unit. no one pressed my doorbell, and no one knocked on my door. i know this because i was right beside the front door to my unit

if it werent urgent, i would not have chosen the first available delivery slot. my experience with you all so far has been very bad. if you werent intending to deliver the sim card, dont give me one missed call and pretend that the delivery failed. you were nowhere close to my unit, so dont lie

either deliver it by 3pm today as promised, or refund me my payment"

The only thing I hope they could improve soon is add in VoLTE service. This is important especially 5G is coming soon.

[Customer Service]
When you pay such a good value service with low cost, don't expect premium customer service.
It's not easy to deal with the ChatBot and the chat services UI is not user friendly.
Patience and presence is what you need to have while you are approaching their agent.
The customers service representative are professional, friendly and helpful.
The only unfriendly part is, although it's a chat support service, you have to wait there patiently within 10 to 30 minutes in order to have the support. You MUST respond to the agent within a short period, otherwise, system will kick you out of the queue, then you have to re-queue and re-wait for the next service agent.

[Ease of porting]
I like the porting processes. It's all digital and easy to use.
The only thing need to be cautious is they might delayed the service the day you port in. What can be happened is you found you had ported out from the existing telco but you are not in giga! yet. You could try to restart the phone a few times. Otherwise, have to ask customer service agent to help. So far, it hasn't created any problem to me yet.

[Mobile App]
Easy to use with user-friendly UI. Other than the Mobile App, you could access the service portal from browser as well. It's friendlier and convenient than a lot of other service providers!

[Billing]
Transparent and consistent billing with no hidden cost. Free caller ID and free incoming call, unlike certain service providers, offer low cost with no free caller ID or no free incoming call.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Aug 2020,Purchased,"Problem faced during sign up for GIGA 40GB for $18 promotion plan on 26 August 2020.

The problem:

On 26 August 2020, I proceeded to assist my father to port in his phone number to GIGA, on his laptop. After creating an account using his e-mail and completing verification, the browser crashed during the registration process. Error message shows up telling us the site is under maintenance. The page was refreshed, and we logged in again, only for the browser to crash again halfway during registration. The page was refreshed again, and after opting to port in, the browser asked for payment details. After payment was made, an error message was shown again and page became unresponsive, received an SMS informing us the money has been transferred. The page was refreshed again, and seemingly no plan has been purchased. Issue was raised to GIGA, and live agent Sarah provided assistance at 2259H.

Subsequently, I received an email notification from GIGA informing me that temporary SIM with a port in request will be delivered to me on previously selected date. This is strange, since the sign up process was done on my father’s laptop, but I have only signed up on my phone’s GIGA app previously. How did the sign up process get transferred from my dad’s account on his laptop, to my account in my phone? I did not provide any consent for my NRIC or account to be used during this new sign up process. 

Sarah did a check and confirmed that the new line is now registered under my account at 0022H, and told me she was having a headache and needed a rest at 0040H.

The next morning, at 1026H, Sarah informed me that her team is doing an investigation on the matter. After multiple prompt for updates, Sarah told me she will get back to me by the end of the day and asked for my understanding that she is doing her best to assist me. At 1821H, Sarah told me they are still investigating and will only be updating me the next day.

After prompting, Sarah got back to me only at 1830H. According to her, the investigation findings confirmed that the line was signed under my name and email address, and the registration process for my father’s account was not completed. She proposed that I complete the registration process and sign up a new line for my father, but we can no longer sign up for the promotion, despite their delay. She reasoned that her late response was because they needed time to investigate to be sure of the findings before reverting me back to me. The investigation process took close to 2 full days only to tell me what I already knew, and was exactly the issue I had raised.

I asked Sarah about the new line that was incorrectly registered under my account, since my father’s port in number belonged to my father, it cannot be ported into my account. Sarah told me that the porting will fail, as they have indicated in the checklist before porting over. Clearly, the checklist was completed on the laptop, but now they make it seem like my fault. I repeated my  problem, and Sarah asked “How can you be in your father’s account. When he has not successfully completed the registration process.” However, I was able to successfully log in to my father’s account.

Sarah then suggest that we go to M1 for my father to transfer the line to me so the porting over can take place.  She also kept insisting that the 40GB for $18 promotion is over and that my father would have to sign up for other available plans.

Sarah then suggested to raise a refund and mentioned that they will get back to me after 7 days. I also had her hold the delivery of the SIM card. When I asked if my father will be getting a refund of $18 + $2 that was charged to his card, Sarah replied “As mentioned, if you do not wish to continue using the giga line, I will submit a refund request for you. In the meantime, can you confirm for his M1 number to be removed from porting in ? If yes I will do so now”.

Now I still have to wait for 7 working days before GIGA can get back to me regarding the outcome of the refund request.

In overall, very disappointed with GIGA and their customer service. I was communicating to the Customer Service Officer via Facebook Messenger, and had to deal with the bot replying my messages even though I was already connected to a CSO. I have already requested to speak to the supervisor or manager."

- Rollover Data benefit (e.g. if I had 10GB unused from previous month, my data for current month will be 25GB + 10GB = 35GB).

[Mobile App] Pretty straight forward. Better than SingTel’s app that has so much bug in it.

[Billing] The beauty of giga is you will not experience bill shock. It’s a postpaid service on a prepaid platform. 

Everything is pay in advance so you don’t get bill shock. If you need additional 100 mins talk time, buy it at $1 else your call will cut off at the last minute left.

Note that they don’t bill by the seconds. Every 1-59 seconds are billed as 1 minute.

If you ran out of data, it will stop your data. Just have to go to the app and purchase 1gb for $2. 

If you do your homework, you know the value is good.

And yes, no pro-rate nonsense. First bill is already the subscription itself. No half month + 1 full month. Very fair. Just an additional $2 for SIM card delivery. 

Last but not least, you get to choose a pool of beautiful numbers.

Please note that I am rating this based on above mentioned experience. I have not came across any customer service with them because I didn’t went into any communication with them, which I know I try to avoid knowing how service level has lapsed over the service industry over the years just like M1.

They bill you immediately when you wish to purchase their SIM, so you lose one month if you choose to port out as and when during your billing cycle. AFAIK, the only telco to do this. Also the only telco to charge for delivery sim fee. 

TLDR; a MVNO with uncompetitive data plans running on ""rollover"" data as a gimmick. Mediocre network one level below starhub, unhelpful CSO, compounded by a massive spending plan on social media influencers to advertise for them. Maybe they should spend that money on better CSO  training and network or plan improvements. For your sanity, pick a different telco. GOMO 30GB for $20 and GRID is better than their offerings at the similar price point. MyRepublic LIte PLan has it's own network issues in my experience but is still way better value than GIGA.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 01 May 2020,Purchased,"Long story short, DO NOT RISK PORTING OVER. 

Absolutely horrible customer service.

Porting over was a process they did not get right on their end. Giga ended up not registering the specific phone number to the correct email address and yet charged me for this unsuccessful porting. 

I asked for help from the live chat since it's the only way to contact them instantly and directly, but the agents complicate things even further, lacked professionalism in responses and offered literally no viable solutions. 

There was no way I could contact them via call or in any store, but only via live chat. Hence, I was basically stranded and scammed since the process of porting over was unsuccessful.

What doesn't help the situation is how Giga responds to all complaints here with the model answer of ""contacting our live chat"". With no solutions provided during live chat, nor evaluation and improvements made in response to the complaints, it really reflects their limited customer care."

I wish I could put 0 stars. It doesn't exist. Feels like you are trying to ask a wall what 2+2 is. It's obviously 4, but the wall doesn't say anything back. The things I am asking their customer service to do is very normal for CS staff to handle, but they just ignore you. They make you wait for hours, tell you submit feedback, ignore your emails, ignore your submitted feedback. And then at the end they have the cheek to ask you for more patience.

Leveraged on Starhub network, pretty good, i get good coverage even in underground carparks that Singtel has no signal in (in Sengkang area). Dead zones are similar to Starhub's network too. Overall 5/5 can't complain too much about it from my use case.

Do remember to set up the apn (if it's not automatic on your phone)

Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 22 Nov 2019,Purchased,"What won it for me after leaving Starhub, are:
1. The sizeable data of their plan (25GB) at a reasonable price, and the option to rollover unused data for 2 months
2. Free caller ID, and 
3. Free incoming call.
4. Upfront and easily understandable terms minus the hunt for hidden clauses in fine print or foot notes. 

  After using the service for a month, in terms of signal strength, be it underground or Tuas, it has been good or alright thus far.

  Support service wise, improvements can be made. It is understandable when a customer needs help for a fix, and to get chat bot responses... high probability it won't go down well. To be fair to Giga, they earnestly did their best to support via email.

  I eventually managed to resolved my initial hiccup with the service, while connected to WIFI that inadvertently rendered direct mobile connection to not work.

Level 9. God of Wisdom,Posted on 16 Oct 2019,None,"My experience switching over was great, It literally took me one weekend to do it, and seamlessly online.

Here is how i changed my SIM ONLY plan over the weekend in six simple steps saving me $10-15 per day.

Step 1: Look at your current bill (mine was with Circles Life)

Step 2: Figure out why you are overpaying (I was using a ton on calling, and 100 minutes was definitely not enough)

Step 3: Use the Seedly SIM ONLY comparison tool 

Step 4: Personally for me, it came down to these two... between final price differences between GOMO ($20 for 20GB, 200 min and 200 sms) and GIGA ($25 for 25GB,1000 min and 1000 sms)

Step 5: Read reviews (like from here!)

Step 6: Submit Port in transfer (Get discounts from online or here)

Update on experience:
- It has been great so far, since switching over
- Customer service has been really helpful in app, with the cat logo
- App has been easy to use and understand with clear visuals UIUX
- Porting over took one working day
- Less calls were dropped (which is awesome)
- Data was more stable in trains (NEL and Circle Line)

Creating an account and porting over was easy as well. Customer officers were friendly and quite prompt when responding to your enquires through the app.

Wrote in to their team and by the following day when I woke up, I was given clear instructions on the potential issues that I needed to fix.

But from the time I chose GOMO, I made a typo to my contact number for the port in and when I contacted the customer service agents, they kept repeating to me what phone number I was enquiring on when I had told them in the conversation about 3times on the number.I felt like they were not hearing me at all. Also, whenever live chat is engaged, there was no indication if an agent would be online at all so oftentimes the customer is left hanging there with their enquiry. Sometimes, it will mention that you are transferred to another agent and someone will tend to you in 5mins but the real timing can be more than 30mins. The extra 5 days of service for the first month is also a joke, because its supposed to start +5 days from the date you signed up for GOMO, I signed up on the 8th and even today on the 18th, I wasn't ported over to GOMO, when i contacted CS on this to change my billing date as I'm being penalized for GOMO's delay in the port in, they told me it is not possible and cited their T&C that customers have to pay for it.

Signed up for a gomo sim only plan on 17 dec. My husband used his credit card to pay for the fee but I filled in all my personal details correctly. Got my card on 19 dec, even received a confirmation email addressed to my name. Then gomo later sends me an sms on 21 dec to inform me of porting over issues from M1 and ask me to contact M1. I called M1 and said no issues on their side for me to port over to gomo. So okay, i wait until 30 Dec to chat with their officer on the gomo app. Officer asks me to fill in a form as there was some mismatch in the personal details which is already super stange if i only key in my own details. I fill in the form, officer acknowledges receipt and tells me to wait 24-48 hrs for the confirmation sms. Up till today, 4 Jan, no confirmation email sent so I chat with another officer on the gomo app who tells me that there don't have an account registered under my name. So i get my husband to ask another officer again and this time that officer tells me that they had sent me an sms on 21 dec to inform me that they were going to cancel my plan because i didn't fill in the form to verify my personal details.

A) did not receive any sms from gomo on 21 dec with any form to verify my details.

B) why do my personal details not match in the first place when I keyed them in correctly.

C) customer service officers clearly are not helpful. Claim that they informed me via sms of the cancellation and no refund. Is this a scam or what?? They advertise promo they cancel contract on customers and claim no refund.

GOMO has by far the worse policies imaginable. Customer service was basically no help at all, you basically threw the poor soul under the bus here.

I purchased the national day Promotion at 50GB for $30 forever. At the end of the billing month, an internal error (and I mean GOMO's internal error) occurred in GOMO which prevented them from charging me. Instead of notifying me or doing any sort of notification, they simply waited for the billing period to be over and changed my plan to 20Gb for $20 and only notified me AFTER the billing date. 

Contacting customer service, they advised me to check with my bank and sent me in circles wondering if there was something wrong with my payment method. After confirming with POSB that in fact no ATTEMPT to charge was made from GOMO and getting an agent to standby in case any need for confirmation is required, and sending them proof did they finally acknowledge an error at hand

Still when I asked to revert back to my old plan they said the best they could do was to provide me  $7 discount (for the next 3 months only). I asked if they could simply re-register me under a similar plan occurring now keeping my original number since I require it for all other needs. They said that it was impossible due to programming issues that wouldn't allow me to re-register or select any other plan and suggested that a $7 discount was sufficient. 

Following which I mentioned that GOMO should take responsibility for the matter and should somehow find a way for an exception to be made since this is THEIR FAULT. Still same 7 dollar discount for their addons which cost $10. (Apply some elementary mathematics here)

Massive disappointment. GOMO take a hike, this was a massive scam and breach of YOUR own terms and conditions. After a mistake is made on your end (especially lying to my face), I'm sure the least you can do is uphold the original contract which you so conveniently decided to ignore. Take some sort of responsibility at least instead of hiding behind your poor customer service agent.

Also, if you're going to say such a situation cannot be reverted because of a obsolete  internal system that can't register a simple Ctrl+Z action, you should really reconsider updating your 1960s era operating system. Gomo a lawn.

A bit inconvenient in that I cant instantly call someone and get help, but instead need to go through the chatbot to request for a human assistance. However, seldom interact with customer service as of now. Not a serious issue for me as im still able to get through and get a response from customer service.

Very easy, just paid $20 for first month and my Singtel plan was terminated. Also had the priviledge of enjoying same day delivery of SIM. Dont understand why there are so many reviews flaming them for porting procedure...😳

[Mobile App]
Clean, sleek UI. Much better than MySingtel app, but works the same. Allows me to easily monitor data usage and purchase add ons for roaming. No complains as it works well for me. Responsive and fast, With nice animations too!

[Billing]
Billing can be done by credit card payment online, I paid online with my credit card and saved my card details. Able to change online too! Seamlesspayment as compared to Singtel where my parents had to pay bills monthly. Sometimes they missed the deadlines and got charged, for late discount and even for reminders too.

I've tried Singtel, M1 and Starhub in the past but felt Singtel's network gave me the best experience, in terms of coverage, network reliability and network speed. Never had my calls drop in lifts or MRT before, or any underground area i've been to for that matter. Switched to GOMO when the new SIM Only No Contract hype started to reduce my teclo bill. Been a great experience thus far, enjoying more data for a smaller payment. Never looked back once! Even upgraded my personal mobile device, from an iphone 7 to an iphone se given the savings ive gotten from a lower bill 😚. 

One bane would be that the GOMO customer support isnt as acessible or convenient as the one from Singtel, where I could easily contact them on whatsapp each time and go about my personal life while waiting for their replies as I would get notified whenever the assigned customer support officer replied to me. Singtel's customer support was also much more responsive as they were available 24 hours, around the clock. For GOMO, not only are they unavailable past working hours, i have to stay on their website to engage a customer support officer. And ive only used the live chat feature on my laptop, which isnt the best experience as i normally miss the notification for replies from their customer service, given the sheer amount of tabs and programs running on my laptop. Hopefully i'll be contacting customer service less as there wont be as many bill shocks or extra charges as compared to my old telco plan...🥺

TLDR: Best network coverage as GOMO is on Singtel's network. Great price for more data, but with the same reliability. However, subpar customer support experience. Especially compared to the previous level of customer support for Singtel mobile plans. 4.5 stars if i could."

Billing is easy where payment is automatically deducted from your bank account monthly. Besides that, easy to sign up as it can be done online and sim card will be delivered to you. However, they are lacking in terms of customer service. When signing up for this plan, I encountered some difficulties and I was looking for some form of customer support. Tried using the robo chat which apparently was the only way for me to talk to someone, but didn't manage to have my queries cleared. There wasn't any contact number on their GOMO site therefore I decided to contact Singtel, only to be told by the staff that the robo chat was the only way for me to contact someone. After many times of trying to search for an answer from the robo chat, I was finally directed to a customer service personnel. It wasn't clear that I had to search multiple times, and only be directed if I couldn't have my queries cleared, which actually resulted in me wasting so much time trying to contact someone."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Mar 2020,Purchased,"I applied for the Sim only mobile plan. I paid the $20, and waited for notifications on collection but didn’t receive anything, no SIM card, no email, no SMS. 2 months later, I asked from the customer service, they said I can’t get the refund because apparently, it’s according to their policy that they don’t give refund if SIM card is lost, damaged, expired or terminated. They did asked me to call SingPost regarding the delivery but it was my fault that I didn’t because I forgot. But I didn’t receive any email/sms regarding the delivery. How is it fair? How do I know that the SIM card was even being sent out? I just feel that gomo could had take more responsibility on this and at least offer to do more eg verifying the order, or my contact details, or sending another new SIM card or liaising with their third party SingPost. All they did was tell me they are sorry and understand my situation, but still can’t refund me. Didn’t offer to do anything or follow up with me in the 2.5 months after I applied for SIM card. And just told me it’s their policy. The worst thing is, if you want customer service, there’s no number to call. Only way is to download the gomo app, chat with a robot. And after a while of not being able to solve your queries with the Robot, then you can chat with a human. But it takes forever for the human to reply. It’s really annoying esp when I am already upset with the problems and still have no one that I can talk to face to face or even through the phone. Bad service.

Firstly, i had to change over ownership of the number from my parents to myself. I purchased the GOMO plan, before proceeding down to my service provider to transfer ownership. I had to pay $20+ for the transfer of ownership but that's alright. After that, i was informed that i had to commit to a minimum 1 month SIM only plan. My GOMO sim was scheduled to be collected in 2 days.

I wasn't aware of the minimum 1 month commitment to a SIM-only plan. As it makes no sense to be paying for the 2 plans on the same month, i contacted GOMO support to seek their understanding and either refund, or delay the request by 1 month as i'm still interested in changing over to GOMO from my current provider. Since my SIM wasn't due yet, it makes no sense that they would proceed with either request. However, they were unable to do so and refused the refund and gave my unsatisfactory scripted responses and not addressing the issue.

I don't understand their rationale as I informed them early 2 days prior to my collection date. Assuming that collection can be done as soon as next day, obviously they haven't started with the application/port over yet. Such a shame that the company is covetous over that $20 and gave up on the possibility of a long-term customer.

I used my extra iphone with home wifi to contact gomo customer service, a staff named RJ served me and put the deliver time of SIM card on 15 Oct 19 between 6pm-9pm. I requested him to put a note on the deliver time after 7pm or just leave it in the riser of my place, as i don’t have other existing line/number and I can’t reach home before 6pm to wait for the post man. RJ said he was unable to do so. End up, the post man came before I back home, the delivery became unsuccessful. So I had to re-arrange the delivery of SIM card again after waiting for 3 days! When I requested re-delivery this is what RJ said “I can't really provide an exact date and time. We'll try to rearrange it as soon as possible and we'll send you update about this”.

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 19 Dec 2019,Purchased,"I went with redONE primarily because I could use data in Malaysia for no extra charge. My recent trip to Kuala Lumpur and Malacca left me very disappointed — slow, spotty coverage that routinely didn’t work. 

Let’s be clear here — redONE’s Amazing 18 plan (offering 6GB for $18) is much worse than Circle Life’s offering (20GB for the same price). If redONE’s key selling point of free data roaming in Malaysia falls away, what’s the point of redONE?

I will certainly be looking for a new provider.

There were also a few other disappointments:
1. The fine print states that the minimum contract length is 2 months. This could’ve been made clearer.
2. There’s no way to upgrade your plan if you decide that 6GB isn’t enough for you. Customer service informed me that I had to get a new number.
3. Customer service on WhatsApp is very slow."

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 29 Nov 2019,Purchased,"IMPORTANT: before i start my review, please note that these 5 star reviews are pretty much orchestrated by redone. They are running a 'lucky draw' for a pair of earbuds when you ""review"" here.

At first, I enjoyed using redone. Affordable and despite several no-signal occasions, I would still call it somewhat reliable.
Now though, I've met several issues: You can't track your on-net, local outgoing, and foreign outgoing calls separately.
Porting was incredibly frustrating.
The bill is complicated (I even created my own version and combined all the infomation from redOne's so called 'bill'; can you imagine, a customer getting so fad up that they just decide to do what the company is suppose to do, on their own?)
Slow and incompetent Email, Whatsapp and Live Chat service. No phone number to call, service is (speculated to be) outsourced to Malaysia, etc..
They don't constantly bug you for your payment; instead, they will notify you 48 hours before closing your account. I understand bills need to be paid on time, but I do not have the time to check the app and/or sms'. Not even a call 48 hours before. They send you one message AT MIDNIGHT, thats it. I've nearly missed the message two times (I'm paying for someone elses account, i dont actually use redone) which would've caused significant inconvenience. Even Singtel would bug you about it when you are late.
I applied for GIRO on one of the accounts and it took nearly 2 months to process. First application was denied because 'Correction Tape Used', which I can safely say never happened. Maybe if the team at redone was competent enough they would've simply rejected it once they received it instead of passing it for GIRO processing and wasting everyone's time. I also requested for redone to add $2 to my first GIRO bill as the bank is running a promotion and it requires the giro deduction to be >/= $10. I simply wanted pay my later bills first. NO REPLIES on all 3 occasions I messaged them about it.

I sincerely hope this company shuts down and a more competent company takes over their position as a good service provider with affordable plans."

Rookie,Updated on 15 Jan 2021,Purchased,First time with Grid but super happy with the porting experience and I was pleasantly surprised when Lin Xuan from Grid customer service called me when there was an issue with porting my number. I have two phones and the other telco didn’t bother to even send an SMS when the porting in failed too... Looks like I am converting that to Grid after the contract ends. Anyhow call quality and data speed on Grid has been great so far.

I recently ported out my number from Grid in the middle of the month. 

As they have charged me for the entire month, I requested for customer service to refund me the pro-rated unused amount. They were not able to do so.

It seems that even though Grid claims to be ""contract-free"", you are effectively locked into a monthly one because they do not process refunds if you were to port-out or terminate your number in the middle of the month.

Lousy service and misleading advertising. Please be aware."

To track usages, you have to access their Grid portal via your internet browser. This seems fine for now, but I would hope there is a dedicated app to begin with, hopefully it's in the works.

Customer service is fast, just hit them up a message on Facebook and they will reply promptly. Kudos to them.

No complaints here. I cannot recall ever having an issue with the data dropping or otherwise, However, I do note that speeds can slow down on the underground MRT lines. Noticeably at Novena/Newton that stretch. Otherwise it's always okay and I always get great speeds.

[User Experience] 1/5
Honestly, Grid Mobile is horrible to interact with in the mobile age. You have to go onto their website to do any customisation, and even then you have absolutely no transparency into how much data/minutes/SMS you're using. You just can't track it until they bill you - which you have to retrieve from their website again by logging in. It's just clunky and inefficient. Worse, if you want to communicate with them, you have to send them an email. I mean, seriously? If I wanted to send emails to get stuff done all the time I might as well go back to office. I don't want to send emails on my own time.

Compared to CirclesLife's incredible app and their option to speak to customer service immediately (although the standard has dropped tremendously there), it's really day and night.


[Billing] 4/5
Billing is straightforward and they charge your credit card directly. So you don't have to do anything. Unfortunately, it's only in your bill that you can see how much data you've been using, and you have to go into their clunky website to retrieve the bill in pdf format. 

The whole experience with interacting with Grid is kind of like you're dealing with a Government agency. It's just not modern.


Conclusion: 3/5
Thankfully for Grid, all their flaws can be looked past because of their stunning 40GB for $24.90 plan. I think it was during a promo and I'm not sure it's still ongoing or not. But it's so refreshing, after years of watching out for data usage and being scared of busting, to be able to watch whatever you want, whenever you want. I'd recommend Grid only if you can get such value-for-money promo. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 02 Jan 2020,Purchased,"I have tried many different telcos (Singtel,Zero1, Circles life, Starhub, TPG) before and am currently using Grid. Was using Starhub Sim only plan previous due to the attractive free unlimited weekend data. What make me decided to port over to Grid are mainly the following 3 factors:
1. Uses Singtel Network (thought it has the most stable network)
2. Free 1GB/mth for data roaming in Malaysia. Great for me since I travel to JB once in a while.
3. Value for money ($24.90 for 35gb data, caller ID, 200min outgoing, 200 sms)

After using it for a month here are the pros and cons I feel about Grid.

Pros:
1. Network is pretty stable and fast in open areas.
2. 35GB of data really cannot be utilized finish no matter how hard I try.
3. The 1GB of data roaming in Malaysia really comes in handy. Even though the network is not very stable but it gets the basic work done (using Grab app and replying messages)

Cons:
1. SLOW and average quality customer service. The only way you can reach them is through email which will take a while for them to get back to you. So far no telcos beats the experience I had with circles life previously.
2. SUPER BAD network in underground (DTL specifically). It is so bad that it’s hard for me to even use telegram. I have absolutely no issue with connectivity (even when streaming videos) when using Starhub in underground previously.
3. NO app and lousy to track my usage at all. Even the website doesn’t has the function of tracking at all. Indeed the amount of data is never ending but the presence of tracking will gives user a sense of safety. 

Might consider to jump to GIGA (since my experience with Starhub is quite positive previously). But the value and 1GB malaysia data roaming are the factors that make me stay with them for now. "

Despite the less than stellar reception and typical dropped calls, i stayed with M1 because i love the customer service. Sadly, this year customer service has gotten from bad to worse. Wait time was bad and when they promised to call back within two hours, they never did. The last straw was when my fren was denied cancelling a submitted plan and reordering (even though the online cs said ok). I had assured my fren that M1 CS is very good and will always try to help esp when you needed to place another order and not completely cancel the contract. Even though 1627 told me it was possible, 1623 was insistent it would not change the order or allow a cancellation in any manner. It was very disappointing to me and my fren. In fact, it was the last straw for me so i just ported my line out and paid the termination fee. I have been disappointed enough by them this year."

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 08 Jul 2020,Purchased,"I have been on Singtel, Starhub mobile plans for the past decade and finally made the switch to try M1 in Dec 2019 when they were having the SIM only promo. 

After doing my sums, it was clear that the M1 SIM only plan was the best deal for me. At just 30GB of data for $20/month, I was paying more than 50% less each month for a much better plan. With Singtel and Starhub, I frequently had to constantly monitor my data usage. I only had a measly 5GB and ended up paying $45 on average for my mobile phone bills as I kept exceeding the data although the price plan was $30 per month. 

As a comparison, I would have had to pay a total of $1813 for a phone with plan ($733 handset + $45/mth for two years) if I had continued on with my corporate plan. With M1, the same handset was $979 without plan + $20/mth for the same period which gives me savings of more than $350!

Application was seamless and conveniently done through the M1 shop online, although porting was a little tricky as I had ported from a Starhub corporate account but thankfully the M1 customer service officer made it a breeze."

I thought I would give an update. I am still using M1 and have changed some of my other family members telco to M1 to take advantage of the multiple corporate discount. The transfer was seamless and I really like their customer service. Yes the signal might drop at some places, but I guess most telco have such events happening to them too. Overall, I am still a supporter of M1.

[14/8/2019]
I have been using this telco for quite a while and changed it at first due to the corporate discount that I have and it happened to be the most value for money. But came to realise that there are actually other good points about this telco that I would like to recommend.

On a whole, I'm glad I changed to this telco because of the good customer service and reliability. The transfer from one telco to M1 was seamless and I had no cut off in my network which was great because it would have been troublesome to be without my phone line.

Secondly, would like to praise the customer service for being fast and helpful. There were times in the past years that I have i) lost my sim card and ii) needed help with network overseas that I needed to call in to the customer service and they have been nothing short of helpful. Even overseas, they manage to waive my overseas call charges to them.

I have since also changed my mum's line to be under my name to enjoy corporate discounts and even the transfer for that was smooth and seamless. I love love love the service given by M1. Oh, not to forget the free 3 M1 numbers I can call to for free - this is so my mum and I can talk all day long (or rather for me to hear her nag all day)

Also, it's useful to have the M1 app on my phone because I can apply for data roaming on the app instantly and have it approved a few minutes later. It's good for me to have live tracking of my data usage, message usage and call minutes usage as well. It is useful for me to ration till the next billing cycle!

The only qualm I can think of would probably be the weak signal when I'm in the train when passing by underground stations such as those on the Circle Line, but that is a small issue for me since I can just listen to music and not scroll through facebook/ instagram/ twitter."

Level 7. Grand Master,Updated on 21 Jan 2020,Purchased,"I've been with M1 as a customer for close to 20 years, and I even worked part-time in M1 head office at International Business Park before. I remember my colleagues and I did nail art painting in office during lunchtime...those were the days! so nostalgic.

In the past, when mobile numbers are not easily ported to another telco, the primary reason is inertia. However, since porting mobile no. is no longer an issue,  if you ask me why I didn't switch to other telco providers, to me, M1 has been nimble enough to provide plans with good value for their customers. 

And even when my sibling's working in Singtel is asking me to switch...I refused! Haha. Because my M1 sim-only plan has so much value. FYI, I'm on 30GB data plan at $33.75 (incl. Caller ID & Itemised Bill service). I watch an hour of YouTube video each day on my commute to work, and I'm still not even using half of the data.

Sometimes, when Singtel broadband at home goes rogue (no connection) on me (argh), I had to use my phone as a wifi hot spot (which means I'm using my M1 data) on my laptop so I can continue doing work...until the home connection comes up again.

Power to M1 and thank you."

However, one thing I must commend is that the customer service hotline is really much better than the other telcos. I've had to wait for over an hour just to hear a human voice on the other telcos, but so far have managed to speak to a customer service rep within 5 minutes on M1, sometimes even immediately. The mobile app is also pretty convenient, is able to help me track my usage with 1 view on the dashboard, and I have so far been able to apply for value-added services easily.

The issue at stake is the fact that while Starhub can repackage their channels (which is their prerogative) it can not do so at the expense of their current customers, which is what Starhub is doing, and getting away with. So the hard choices you refer to are hard only for the customers (hundreds of customers, who are all fuming right now), not for Starhub.
If you were really concerned about your customers, you would retain the choices of the current customers (or offer something equivalent), while offering whatever you want to offer to entice new customers. Anything else is simply lip service to customer service."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Apr 2019,None,"Currently on the $25 SIM-only plan (12-month contract I think) with $5 bill rebate for 6 months ($5 bill rebate is before GST). 

Some background: used to be on a 24-month contract with StarHub, before I switched to the SIM-only XS plan, and then most recently to the latest $25 plan. I had initially wanted to switch telcos to SingTel but decided to stay with StarHub in the end (more details below).

StarHub's customer service has certainly improved over the years. While I used to have to wait on the phone for ~1h to speak to a human being, nowadays I can just send in an enquiry (via email/webform) and I will receive an email/call the next day to follow up on my case. I once even received a call on a Saturday. Really feel that they have taken steps to improve customer service and satisfaction, so kudos to them.

In contrast, I had a very bad experience with SingTel. Wanted to switch telcos but the website kept denying my attempts and told me to call their hotline. Tried calling in as asked, only to be forced to navigate through a very dumb interface -- I selected the call category that I thought was most relevant, only to be hung up upon and told to read the website (received a URL via SMS). If I had managed to find the answer online, I wouldn't have needed to call in right?? I also sent in a general enquiry via webform, and they never got back to me despite saying that they would do so within a week. I hence remained with Starhub.

Overall, StarHub's mobile coverage is pretty good and fast. Sometimes it lags a bit, but for the most part it works fine. I wish they would include free SMS in their plans (though I do recognise it's not a popular service anymore) and give bill rebates for a longer time, considering the equivalent plans in other telcos cost around $20 only.

I am data heavy but I connects automatically to free wifi pretty much in malls and home so every month I don't exceed 3gb (though I could since my plan is 4gb). Usually uses WhatsApp calls but occasionally still have to do normal calls for reservations etc.

SINGTEL:

Pros: 10gb/mth @ $36.05 (+2gb if switch to ST on SIM only now) comes with 150mins talk time + 500 free local SMS. Free ST wifi across Singapore if you're ST postpaid customer.

Cons: Bad service both at counter and call operator level. I was just changing my phone 6 weeks ago at ST; made appt online but got confusing SMS from ST, called them back and operator told me my collection point is at Jurong when I clearly selected AMK. After arriving at AMK I was made to wait an hour plus for nothing and no service recovery. Also, when you are tied to contract with ST they do not auto upgrade you to be on par with their new packages. Example you registered for 4gb (4g network) @ $65/mth 2 years back; even if new package is $40/mth you'll be charged at $65 even after your contract is over. Also, when I sign up for 4g network I will want 4g network say 80% of the time. Not 3g. ST cheated my feelings.

STARHUB

Pros: 6gb + unlimited weekend data @ $24 (12 mth contract) and if you're overseas you can simply turn on dataroam @ $15 for 2gb (valid 1 mth) so it's really convenient.

They also used to upgrade existing users FOC to new package so long as you're not under contract. If you were paying $65/mth for 4gb, you may notice you have 6gb because they upgraded you. They will send you a letter to inform you and this is what I like them. Don't think they are doing now though.

Cons: Technical glitches. Past 3 months I've been experiencing constant glitches from them. First I had data roam which I used in Taiwan which was okay but when I go to Malaysia the next week it couldn't connect at all. I called in to verify and all was verified ok so I entered Malaysia again the next week and again no signal. Called operator again and was told it is an IT glitch which they are trying to solve (2 weeks at least - really?) Also let's not forget their massive breakdown just last week. My phone is on SH postpaid and my home wireless is SH too. So if there's totally no signal; it's not just cable and fibre broadband issues. Their technical team needs to buck up.

Zerox:

Pros: unlimited everything for first 3000 sign ups at only $65/mth.

Cons: Not for everyone. Do you really need unlimited everything when you can get wireless pretty much everywhere now and cheaper plan @ $30 and below?

Circles life:

Pros: 8gb for $28/mth no contract and comes with 100 min talk time... Unlimited WhatsApp free and deliver the constant 4G promise. I stay and live in town but often goes around to East, North and West of SG. While I always get 3G signal in Orchard for ST & SH, circles life gave me 4G. I did a free trial with circles life last year and it certainly surprises me. Let's not forget free roaming and free caller number display which ST & SH charges for basic necessities.

Cons: No SMS but not a big deal because to be honest you can contact everyone on WhatsApp/line pretty much these days.

Sorry for the long post but this is why I chose circles life! Hopefully circles life stays competitive in terms of both pricing and service level so I can support them on a continuous basis."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"[TL:DR - Comparison with previous provider]

I'd consider myself an average phone user. I don't make or receive too many calls, don't send too many SMSs, and use about 6GB of data month. I don't stream Spotify, Netflix or YouTube on mobile data usually.

I was previously with M1 for about a decade on a plan with a corporate discount.

I'm now saving >50% a month with no major differences to my experience. 

So, I consider switching to ViviFi a win.

Only minor issues are a lack of an app to check usage. That said, the website serves the same function and the only extra step is the need to login each time.

[Plans]

For my usage pattern the 6GB plan is the most cost-effective for me in the market. I unfortunately happened to exceed the 6GB limit towards the end of the first month because of an app which updated on mobile in the background (disabled it later on) so my internet speed was throttled to 256kb/s or something like that. Videos would take longer to load and Facetime was a little iffy but this is to be expected. Whatsapp, however, worked without issue which is the most important thing (primary purpose of the mobile phone anyway). Much better than being slapped with a $10/GB excess usage charge which other telcos charge!

I have another Lite 3GB plan for my dad who uses no data but talks a lot on the phone. The 500 min talktime is great. ViviFI offers the most competitive plan for such users. Only downside is you get 20 SMSs which isn't much, but even if you send 100 SMSs at 5 cents a SMS you're probably still ahead. Or buy a booster with 100 SMSs at $3.

[Network]

Probably better than M1. In terms of call signal no difference but I find there is greater internet connectivity. Whereas I used to occasionally not be able to access the internet even though I was connected to the M1 network (had to reboot the phone to solve the issue), I thankfully don't experience this with ViviFi. If there's network signal, you will have internet.

Network speeds for regular browsing/social media seem the same to me.

I've found it fast and responsive, possibly even better than speaking with a person over the phone as you don't have to hang around and wait for your call to be connected.

ViviFi has been very quick with resolving ViviFi specific issues (change of plans, replace SIM card). 

I've also been pleasantly surprised by how they've gone the extra mile. I lost my phone and needed a replacement SIM card. The request was processed quickly and they said they would dispatch the replacement by normal mail. This is reasonable and what I expected. I got a call an hour later asking if I'd be at home later in the day as someone would drop the SIM card off. I said I wouldn't but they could just leave it under the door. The replacement was indeed delivered later that day and it was clear one of their staff hand-delivered it (there was no courier note and it was in a hand-labelled envelope). Sort of reminds me of what a lean start-up trying their best to keep their customers happy would do. Who knows, maybe it was the CEO who hand-delivered the package. It felt strangely authentic and personal. So, full marks for this!

They've been helpful with trying to solve phone specific issues but their advice is pretty generic. That said, Google's probably better for these latter types of problems.  

[Ease of Porting]

If you self-collect the SIM card, you have to meet at locations specified by ViviFi. A little troublesome if you need your SIM card ASAP but it's reasonable if you don't want to pay a fee. 

The line was ported over in the middle of the night so I didn't suffer any actual inconvenience. Porting the number over is as convenient/inconvenient compared to other service providers. I don't think there can be a 100% seamless experience regardless of who you switch to. It's just how it is. 

The only issue I had was when I eagerly tried my ViviFi SIM card the moment M1 cut my service. I don't think the port-over process had been completed yet so my iPhone registered the new temporary ViviFi number, messing up my FaceTime and iMessage. Couldn't remove the new number. I spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this (ViviFi couldn't help me unfortunately) but eventually I found out that I just had to wait for Apple to update its servers and I could re-register my ported over number. Long story short it wasn't ViviFi's fault and I think a potential issue when one changes providers. Best to just not do anything till after ViviFi's specified port-over period.

[Billing]

I very much like how ViviFi usage period is the calendar month, not the date you join them. Makes managing your data and minutes usage a lot easier.

No issues with credit card billing either."
Level 5. Genius,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"They used singtel network, so I think the reception and signal is the best out there already. Just don't expect any customer service. The website is quite bare minimum, and there is no app to track live usage, so that means you have to log in to the website to check. For me, I had some problems with the delivery of the sim cards, so the delivery guy had to come again, at my own expense of course. One of the cheapest plan for their who don't need a lot of data, so can't complain much."

But can’t explain why people need to write to them to apply for “port out”, while I already instructed then to terminate. They just want your money. You won’t be able to know if your line is terminate until you see the card bill. Sorry you will be charged for another month because it will only terminate the service at the end of the month.

I have the habit to put my phone to airplane mode at night. But I noticed that upon turning back on the phone, the connectivity to 4G+ is quite instant without noticeable lag. Despite Vivifi being a MVNO, the customer service is considered quite good. Prompt response through the WhatsApp customer chat. Billing cycle is at every first day of the month. So you don't have to headache when is your next billing cycle. Best part is, if you finish using either your entitled air time, data, or SMS of the month, you got to top up value to the wallet before able to reload the service that you require. As I use this line mainly for work purpose, it is good that I do not exceed either my call time or data and get charged automatically. I have the freedom of choice on whether I want to top up and pay or not. Can't comment on the porting because I took a new number. Mobile App wise, I don't see any so far.

I was browsing through the best operators currently in Singapore and I got a lots of them! It was really hard to choose between them, however, as per my usage and need I selected Vivifi and was not very sure whether my expectation will fulfill. To my great surprise the purchase process just took couple of minutes and as promised they delivered the new SIM in just 2 days! More to my surprise this request was actually for a port in number and I was scary what will happen to my old number if port in fails, but the process was like driving your car in an empty highway! The day the new SIM was delivered that night only the port in happened without any interruption as it took place between 12 am and 4 am. Next day morning when I switched on my phone the port in success message was delivered and it was so sweet :-) Till now there is no problem in tracking my usage, no issue in internet speed, call quality is very good.

I've been switching around with a multitude of MVNOs, struggling to find the perfect operator.

[Pros]
- VIVIFI has provided me with exceptional customer service, even replying to my queries almost immediately at 11pm!
- Network coverage is great - significantly better than MVNOs backed by StarHub. Very stable at most times even in underground tunnels.

I had a seamless experience for number porting my M1 number that belonged to to my mom.

The lack of mobile app is a plus point for me, we do not need another app that serves little purpose and then bloat it with unnecessary things like games/polls/offers. It is as clean and functional as it should be.

The drawback of Vivifi is the lack of an always-available customer service. Vivifi does not have a contact number and respond only through emails during working hours on weekdays.

Getting Sim Card - opted for delivery via post which was a huge mistake. 
Singpost lost the card + CB period so i didn't get my card at all (wasted 3 weeks waiting)

Customer Service - sent in a ticket for the above problem, customer service was quite efficient, even replying my email at 10+pm!  At the end i requested for another form of getting my sim card, and they scheduled me for the day itself immediately to get my card at Punggol mrt, which wasn't that near for me but acceptable.

Porting and Network range - vivifi is using Singtel network so no issues at all. Porting took place in the middle of the night so no disruption occurred.
