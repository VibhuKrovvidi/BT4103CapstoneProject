       "'Very Professional People down there. Recommended⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very patient kind respectful.. very smooth throughout the Medical Check-up. Unlike what the other reviews may suggest, people here were adequately friendly(like anywhere else in sg). The place is really clean and efficient The place overall is fine. Good experience. Just a tip if any of u going for medical checkup. DONT GO LATE OR ELSE U have to come back other day to complete the rest. I went there for my NS Checkup today 29 August 8am... Here is what I went through:  Gate Entrance: Security Check & Counter, Take a Sticker Pass and just WALK THROUGH the gate... Don\\'t be like me...I stood there thinking I can scan the … Don\\'t bother showing up at the timing assigned to you, you\\'ll end waiting for more than 2 hours only to realise that you\\'re the last person in line. Doctors don\\'t really care which is fair because they don\\'t really have a choice but to be there. This place is a complete waste of space and time. just here to read through the NSF reviews LOL Takes a extremely long time due to waiting. Overall a complete waste of time. All staff are professional and knows what they are doing. Idk what the bad reviews is about but for my personal experience, everyone there is very helpful and take initiative to help me out. Unfriendly staff. The guards are doing their job but the staff keep pushing them to do more stuff which they are not suppose to. Absolutely atrocious. There is one woman at the VAC who keeps changing her tone when she talks to people and threatens people to leave. She always removes her mask to talk to people to show her expressions. staff at medical screening station 5 for height and weight is extremely rude and unfriendly Staff were not serious; impatient. Undesirably long waiting times. Would not recommend CMPB to a friend. Just sent my son for the pre enlistment checkup this morning.  The guard at the entrance couldn\\'t give clear instructions.  Keep shouting when we got our son to alight since we couldn\\'t drive further in. Hello please train your army … One of the most inconvenient locations I have ever seen. Terrible directions. Rude staff. Expect this whole process to take hours. 100% not recommended. Ok lah, this review is based on my visit January 1990, so maybe sikit out of date. NSF staff was ok, typical bo chap, happy like bird to  tio a switch off vocation. MO, on the other hand, seemed si peh buay song. This is probably because he … Tbh, its not that bad of a place to visit, contrary to what others are saying. Those enlisting here, PLEASE make sure you declare all medical conditions. severe or minor, to the Medical officer during your checkup.  If you do not believe you will fare well in combat/PES-fit BMT, do get a medical specialist letter from … Guards at gate very rude. Ask question they ignore you. The rest of the staff are nice and friendly though. Overall great experience and medic was professional with blood draw Very kind people inside CMPD medical check up. Was constantly greeted with smile and patience. don\\'t bully me Meh. Staff is pretty nice. Lousy service dk how help people. Ask question also say dont ask me not my taiji... [28/08/18] Tuesday With all the negative reviews, thought I could share my quick personal opinion. Perhaps it varies from person to person, but my trip to CMPB was ultimately great and definitely a memorable experience :)!  The medical … Medical check up place for SAF Me and others were treated like dirt. Was here for pre-enlistment screening, a few Counselling sessions & to answer a charge. Inconvenient location. No cookhouse. NSF need to spend $$$ out of their meagre pay. the officer attitude is not good and no patience to service. i just don\\'t understand what that he say and he use the unfriendly tone to repeat to me with another language Idk why so many people give negative reviews on this place went there for medical check up the staff is friendly the nsf are cool overall i had a good experience there. The gold star of public service Expect yourself to be waiting for at least 3hrs here for any form of meeting. Even till your really bored. Cold air conditioning no wifi Not accessible at all. extremely poor and rude customer service Worst Day of My Life. Wooo, real edgy, ziyuan, you should be a novel writer Highly inaccessible. So hard to get there not near any MRT stations. bane of my existence :( No cookhouse but get to book out everyday. Most troublesome thing is discussing what\\'s for lunch. Sidenote: 菜贩@canteen B is bad, real bad How do people even go to this place... Middle of nowhere.. officer talk to you like you own them money be prepared and very hard to get there like middle of a village or something Rude staff Inaccessible need 1h travel time to waste more of your time. So far away in the middle of nowhere. Very bad Security troopers who have very bad attitude towards public in the middle out of nowhere Place is not well kept, people working there are unbelievably rude. Bad service Interestingly enough, all the negative reviews were removed. Bad service So sheat!

I am an ASA right now and have been for 3 months. shld I aim for Command Sch. I am currently going through my BMT Phase and honestly I am quite lost and confused. I would appreciate if anyone here could advice me. Majority of my platoon mates/friends are all aiming for command school and i can\\'t help but feel pressured to aim for it as well. I don\\'t have a strong interest to go unlike my peers at this juncture but my friends have been advicing for me to aim for it so that I can grow as a person and gain something along the 2 years. I kind of agree with them that I wld want to grow individually after my ns journey but I am still stuck in a sense whether I shld aim for it although I dont have much interest to lead now and whether i am suited for it. \\n\\nI know this may be a subjective question but wld like to hear from those who been through whether it is really worth it overall?

Is it possible to sign on as PES C9. Hello! A little bit of context here. I’m currently at the start of my National Service, enlisted on 2 April to BMTC School V but was sent home due to circuit breaker. Because of this, I’m having difficulty gathering the necessary information I need for a potential army career.\\n\\nI spoke to my section commander over videocall a few days back about the possibility of signing on, and from what I gather from him, the only possible route I can take will be the Military Expert scheme because I am not combat fit and therefore wouldn’t qualify for officer scheme, and because I will be starting a degree in 2022, WO Spec will not be suitable as well. Just to do a fact check, can I really sign on as an ME as a C9?\\n\\nA little bit more background; I was downgraded by the MO back when I did my checkup as I have mild eczema and childhood bronchitis. Nothing more than that. When I had my one to one interview with my PC, he was equally taken aback because the downgrade might’ve been a little too drastic. Hence, if there were to be a need that I’ll have to up PES in order to sign on, I guess my chances are there as well?\\n\\nWould appreciate any information/feedback regarding the above issue :) I’ll be booking in on the 8 of May, and my Section Commander has stated that if I do have intentions of upping my PES status, he will send me to the MO straight on 8 May.

Get a heart Problem.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOh yeah, be sure to tell everyone in your Coy that you successfully keng until you down Pes! Everyone will love you for it.\\n\\n> clerk or video editor?? (I have experience in video editing) which my friend told me is possible but idk \\n\\nSAF don\\'t give a fuck about your qualifications or experience, you only serve 2 years so it doesn\\'t matter for them enough.\\n\\n \\n\\n>Anyways, any advice?\\n\\nSuck it up, don\\'t be a cunt about it. Just serve.\\n\\nIf you pretend or manage to down pes with some BS, when they find out it\\'ll be worse than having done \" 2 years of hell\". Oh, and ASA isn\\'t as easy as you might think; it\\'s not a \"easy and chill\" vocation. nan Actually being PES B1 doesn\\'t mean you will get a physically demanding vocation, it just means you are eligible for it. I know people who are B1 but get posted to driver, storeman, etc. Basically a game of luck. Hey man I understand where you\\'re coming from but it is not worth it to keng and down PES. I was from the obese batch BMT ( 5 months ) and now PES B1 but I was posted to driver. Its good and bad to be in PTP batch (which is what you are in) as you have lots of time to really get to know your friends inside, which will make time fly by quickly ( but 4 months++ is still something lol.) It is just 2 years, take it as a break from the real world. You do not need to try your best, just live day by day and spend your bookout with your loved ones, it will be over fast.\\nAll the best for your NS journey! What about people who pretend to require a down PES? like I\\'ve heard of ppl pretending to be depressed and stuff Eh, but that\\'s already an unlikely scenario in the first place.  Not that I have any official statistics or anything, but I doubt that there\\'s a shortage of PES C and E servicemen, which means that OP could very well end up being sent to a combat vocation. sure, there are cases like that. my brothers bmt batch had a guy who pretended to have low iq and straight pes f. do you really want to pretend having something that you dont tho? it feels disrespectful to the people actually suffering from it,  train yourself up so that ptp wont be as tough and you can handle it better than your peers, you will meet all kinds of people in ns and just learn to keep a healthy distance from the troublemakers. i cant speak for saf, since im in a different service but from what ive heard from my friends who enlisted earlier and those in bmt now, pes b1 doesnt mean you will get chiong sua unit, sure you have a higher chance but anything can happen, dont be an ass to others, try to learn quickly ( unlike me) and understand that your sgts and sirs dont really hate you, in the end most of them are NSFs and are waiting for the much awaited ORD. i would advice not to downpes by doing something to yourself as it could affect your life forever, ns is 2 years. why do something when no one gives a fuck where you were from in work, you can be ocs/ndu/commando/guards/scdf/inspector/infantry/storeman/driver asa end of day you just want to pop, ord and complete your cycles.\\n\\nmake good friends and treasure your remaining few months and time you have with your loved ones, dont keep counting down to it you will feel worse. i wish you all the best and good luck in ur ns journey I’m just curious why you don’t trust your brother who has went through NS of 2 years and instead come here to ask.\\n\\nYes there’s only confinement in PTP Confinement is only during PTP, however, there\\'s multiple reasons for booking out on Saturday.\\nThere\\'s stuff like field camp that might eat into the weekends, there\\'s also weekend guard duty, and some coys just do Saturday bookout etc. nan All said, dont be surprised if you ever book out on a Saturday morning/aft instead of a Friday night. It happened to me quite a bit when I was in BMT. nan Quite unlikely to bookout on the Saturday tbh, since ptp batch have a lot of time, activities no need to be rushed. Furthermore, there are not many other companies to fight against for a good bookout time I assume you\\'re talking about the BMT phase after PTP. Jokes on you, since you\\'re from the PTP batch, they\\'ll try to clear your high keys earlier compared to the Enhanced (Non-PTP) batch. This means doing things such as your grenade throw etc earlier compared to your batch mates. \\n\\nNormal bookouts should have you out by Saturday morning, but if your Saturday is taken for training (yes, it happens, especially for high key events where special venues are required), you may end up booking out Saturday evening. Profile says \"fuck life don\\'t pussy out\" look and here he is. X to doubt Go to ur OC or encik tell it straight to them most probably a emergency send out will be done. Lmao typical chao keng loser. Before you fuckers downvote me, his profile says otherwise. Have fun being a bottom bitch in this here mean green war machine. But by all means do ask for help Please stop using \"Forgot to apply\". It\\'s almost impossible to forget to apply when all your batch mates are applying.\\n\\n1) As a NSF, you have 2 or 3 times to apply for Uni since uni starts in August. \\n\\n2) Let your PC know in advance when your test date if it\\'s on the weekdays. Usually Uni will cater interview on Saturday for NSF. usually if you have a test or interview for uni stuff just let your commanders know in advance and they\\'ll try to release you for it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nwhether or not you have time to study really depends la. i\\'m from a welfare coy so we get more admin time, meaning more study time. other coys who are more xiong might give you less (or negative) admin time so you can only study at night (past lights out, don\\'t get caught) or during bookouts.  either way, if you intend to study during BMT, only advice is to work fast so you dont waste precious admin time on your phone or slacking when you could be studying. You can apply for university every year until your year of matriculation. Local universities will reserve your spot till you complete NS while foreign universities depend on their policies - generally a year but do enquire with their admissions office.\\n\\nUniversity admissions usually has an interview and/or test. They can be conducted for any days but do inform your PC about it and they can allow you off to go for these admission tests. Else, the most they can do is for you to take an annual leave for it.\\n\\nGenerally, the tests are not very technical in nature and do not require extensive study UNLESS you are going for advanced placement modules(generally for polytechnic students). Do some people apply to university after NS? I almost nearly \"forgot\" to apply as a poly student. The application closed while I was still in school and I didn\\'t even know the application was open. Luckily one of my friends asked me if I had submitted my application and I did it on the spot. It was the 2nd last day of the applications. Ah to be fair, the forgot to apply is cos I haven\\'t enter BMT yet.  \\nThanks and ah didn\\'t realize the interview was on Saturday. I think have but why waste time. Since you might get rejected then need wait a bit longer Very unlikely, if not impossible Nope. In jc year 2 now? If yes, then impossible alr. Later you kena Guards. Lol When would I know if I kena Guards? I never indicate interest for that. Where does the anxiety stem from? Might have to explain that to MO.\\n\\nThough, can see them excusing you from smart 4 and make you wear long 4 instead. Yes If that is the case, I\\'ll be going to IMH a&e tmr~~~~ Specialist > mo. If psycologist says excuse uniform, mo will excuse you. Whether IMH psychologist gives you what you want is a different question Google it :D Call up your new unit and ask.\\n\\nThis one, I\\'m not sure. My time was just wear No.3 book in with the sling bag, note pad, and water bottle. I dont think you HAVE to do the pre enlistee ippt, but im priddy sure you can. Passing your ippt wont make your pes go up as your pes is dependant on whether you have any medical conditions, not on how physically fit you are. Passing won\\'t up pes, you just skip 8 weeks ptp if you pass Pes b2 doesn\\'t have to take pre enlistee ippt, it doesn\\'t matter if you pass or fail everyone in b2 goes through 9 weeks bmt / 2 years service.\\n\\nNo of course passing won\\'t get you to pes a/b1, thats your medical status not a measure of your fitness. Need to see MO if you want to up/down pes. Is this fear due to pre-existing conditions or what? If you OOC due to injury and your injury is deemed too serious, you won’t be able to recourse and you’ll just end up in a slack vocation after a possible downpes. In which case no SCGP for you since you won’t attain a 3SG rank. Ooc then no more 3sg unless you recourse with the next batch. But that\\'s unlikely With Ur medical condition you\\'ll end up in a  slack CSS vocation (storeman, driver, asa). If you ooc pro term they will try to push you to become to sgt anyway like admin spec. Most pro term ooc ppl becomes specs and majority of them get hq stayout vocations tbh theres no diff being a REC and a PTE. Only the hair afaik there is no significant difference btw a rec n pte tho. same pay, essentially the same rank (who tf wears a pte badge?) and same hierarchy. the one reason for this might be that you dont have a posting yet so they cant promote u? just don waste the 2 years and enjoy the measly pay. You said one month bmt? Are you PES E? PES E are locked at REC for 6 months after bmt Bruh. The promotion will happen in due time, who cares if you’re a recruit or a private between now and then. You seem very fixated on the black and white of ‘only privates are eligible for promotion’. nan nan It takes time. The system quite slow. Not very quick. I was an ASA for my NS, had to do some paperwork for my own promotion too. \\n\\nThe rationale behind the delayed promotion is so that the \\'real soldiers\\' don\\'t get angry that the \\'chao keng\\' gang get a fast tracked promotion/more money. My advice would be to approach your PS/PC for help with your addiction rather than attempting \"any creative ways to make more money as an NSF\" because that\\'s the definition of moonlighting; making more money outside of what they give you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-Approach your PS/PC for help, there are protocols to assist servicemen with financial problems.  \\n\\\\-This does not affect you negatively in any manner, at the least much less than if you attempted moonlighting.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, I have no idea what FL services are but if you know you\\'re addicted stay away from those kind of things. You need to seek help for your addiction, and not finding for more ways to earn money to feed it. Spending all of your money is a deleterious habit, especially if you’re blowing all of that on chicken and not saving the cash instead.\\n\\nLook, at the end of the day I know it’s your cash, your life, your rules. But now you’re admitting that you have an addiction. Something in your life is out of balance.\\n\\nTalk to someone. Have you considered opening an investment account with the help of your parents? Giving tuition on weekends is an easy way to get money, it doesn\\'t take up much time too if you can convince the students to go to your house.\\n\\nCan\\'t remember the market rates... I think for secondary school, it is about $30-40 per hour?\\n\\nBack then, I just wake up around 10am, brush up, prep the area and chill until 11am. \\n\\nStudent come in, teach until 12+, goes for lunch and rest of the day is mine. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you do it on sat and sun, that\\'s an easy $60-80 per week, which adds up to at least $360-$480 per month. And what did it cost? Your morning? :D Whatever job you take on the weekends/free time, take your pay in cash. Don\\'t take pictures, don\\'t be seen. Best if you do warehouse packing. Whats FL services? nan Brother, it is not that I don\\'t want to give tuition but my grades are UUAS/ABU. Like that how to give? boy is getting ripped off then :0\\n\\nI guess I too good boy liao. This one never hear before. you talking about jc grade or sec sch grades?\\n\\nmy jc grades were CDEC lol. it’s pretty fked up.\\n\\ndid decently well in sec sch tho, so i teach at that level lah Local FL average is around 500 leh at Singapore bike forums FR 500/1/1?Never heard of such price in sg.i really want to know.can u pm me? Yes if you have a transport hr account. Your unit S1 can activate it for you. I’m enlisting on the same day and time so see you there I guess! nan Not really, but just wanted to see if anyone here knows nan Thank you for telling me! nan Thanks! Confinement just got over :) Pes BP is fuckin fun bro. Because its 19 weeks all your activities are spread thin which basically means you get a ton of admin time everyday. The first 8 weeks, expect 2-3 pt sessions a day, but its still manageable because of the emphasis on progressive training. Relax bro dont take it too hard. Am PES BP recruit done with PTP phase.\\n\\nTypical day would look like this during your first 10 weeks...\\n\\n|Time|Activity|\\n:-:|:-:|\\n|0530|Reveille|\\n|0545|Breakfast|\\n|0700|First Parade in PT kit|\\n|0730|PT|\\n|0930|Admin/Lecture/Other Activity|\\n|1130|Lunch|\\n|1430|Admin/Lecture/Other Activity|\\n|1630|PT|\\n|1800|Dinner|\\n|1900|Last Parade|\\n|2230|Lights Out|\\n\\nQuite slack but PT is going to be tough because they will make you run, push up and crunches a plenty. \\n\\nYou\\'ll also be doing 3 klick route marches during PTP phase and one or two actual BMT stuff. Run a total of 5km for Morning and Afternoon and swimming daily for first few weeks I think Ah I see thanks bro! Idts leh... i was from last year pes BP call SAF hotline :( bruh like dat also want to complain abt being unfair? how about complain before ns compulsory guys don\\'t have to serve.... I’m guessing you just POPd.... yes but i still report back to camp bruv just find this to be very dumb complain Not u shinryu I was talking abt OP He just salty at our batch So he want us to suffer Idiot Higher pay like what... that’s not going to happen ya this thread is dumb lmao I understand why he’s upset but like just let him vent I guess it won’t change either way ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ bruh ur basically complaining about doing what you USUALLY would be doing for NS. suck it up stop acting like a quniang and get over it Go complain to your superior and see what he says or if you really unhappy go to news So you think you should be paid more because ur risking ur life, but how does extending our ord benefit you? You just want us to suffer because you have to go into camp Our batch having one month added to our ORD won’t affect wether you get the virus or not... ur just salty I understand your frustration but not your suggestion that the April enlistees should have their ORD extended by at least a month. Feels like \"I am suffering now, so they must suffer too\".\\n\\nSorry bro, NS is like that, the older batches will always say the newer batches have it easy (\"back in my day...\"). And we\\'re all in the same boat of having to serve the nation, so let\\'s not sow discord among ourselves. this is some fucking boomer mentality jesus, just bc you “suffered” means other people should “suffer” as well? get over yourself agree with the increasing pay part but i feel like the ord date for new recruits should not be extended because it is just their good luck and we should feel happy for them lol I definitely feel you tho, as someone who\\'s considered essential service and serving a month long confinement, it definitely sucks to see other NSFs working from home for the same duration. What\\'s worse is when all dies down our compensations is probably a whatsapp text saying \"Thank you for all your sacrifice and service in the past few weeks, we are so proud of you.\" The end. It would definitely be great if there were some form of welfare given back to us that we actually would appreciate and personally for me that would be off days instead of cheap fleeting words of thanks and recognition.\\n\\nBack to the point of the recruits, wishing for their ORD date to be pushed back will only make you feel your life is better - by comparison and accept your situation more but objectively it doesn\\'t really make your life better. Rather when wishing others had it worse so our situation looks better, I just hope we get better taken care of. understand where you coming from however does it do any good if extend their ORD? let\\'s due to this crisis ask you extend your ORD to help out with ops leh? you sure rage what. I only can say they are lucky ar. if you have any concern just speak to your commander about it. everyday alot of negative news liao. so just focus on the positive one all of us owe 2 years and need to pay 2 years. when I suffering and see people relax I also cannot say extend their ORD. nan bruh i POPed the same time as you and i’m going back to camp too lmao If your S1 wants to keep you, then youll stay an ASA. If they rather you hold rifle go pew pew, then youll rebmt, assuming theres enough time - BMT 2 months, voc training 2 months. If you can serve \\\\~1 year after you revocationalise, then most likely they will revocationalise you. Ok thanks for your help. Rifle pew pew once enough alrdy tbh Really depends on how u look at things ar. \\n\\nCommander comes with great responsibility as they need to take care of your man. \\n\\n2 years is a long time. Maybe u can start to look at how u can improve yourself as person. Is okay if your goal is abit diff from others :) after all it is your milestone :) Hey, despite what everyone says, it comes down to whether or not you personally prefer that sort of life. If you think that you are unable to handle too much pressure or dont think that you want to do it at all, then being a man is perfectly fine. Remember, serving 2 years as a man can still be meaningful. It is just what you make of it. Meaningfulness is what you make of it, so don\\'t be pressured to go to cmd sch just to get sth out of NS. I suggest you ask around for others\\' experiences in OCS/SCS before you make a decision. The more info you have the better a decision you can make for yourself. Also, asking whether command sch is worth it is a very personal opinion so I suggest you ask more probing questions about life there suited to your concerns so you can decide for yourself whether it is worth it. Personally, yes. Being a commander gives you more freedoms and allowances to do your things, but do note it does come with additional responsibilities. If you haven\\'t yet, I suggest keeping and open mind and going through field camp first before coming to your definitive decision.\\n\\nI should add that on my end, I wanted to go command school to help myself grow and put myself out of my comfort zone. Basically, I went in of my own accord, and to prove myself, not other people. I can say it definitely helped me grow as an individual faster than I would have outside and even where I fucked up there were lessons I learnt from it all.\\n\\nIt\\'s a great time also to practice your leadership skills, and at the very least, that\\'s something you can carry over to the working world (yes, army leadership isn\\'t exactly the same as civilian leadership, but there are some things you can carry over). If you\\'re unsure tbh then your BMT is a great time to try out leadership and to see how interested you are in it - ask for a platoon IC role for instance if you wish and see how comfortable you are with it. And know it\\'s okay if you don\\'t feel like command school material or are just disinterested. It\\'s a personal choice and one shouldn\\'t be forced to go command school - I never forced my own recruits to go there, for instance, and I respected their decision no matter what, whether they wanted to be a man or commander.\\n\\nEnd of the day, I feel this is a decision you should make - We can only advise and show you the way, you take the step :) I guess it’s quite easy to be swayed and follow the general crowd of wanting to go to command school but it really isn’t the thing that defines a meaningful experience. If you didn’t really have much of a leadership experience prior to NS, it could be good to take this plunge of becoming a commander, a decent opportunity to learn new stuff. But at the end of the day, if wanting to be a leader in this organization is not your thing, it’s fine to not go command school.\\n\\nBeing a man has its perks too and moreover it’s only two years of your life. There’s much more things to pursue during NS and it’s easier to do so when you are just a man. It’s perfectly fine to not follow the hype if you don’t want to. When you\\'re in bmt, everyone dreams to have command. But when you\\'re a commander, you would wish to just be normal men. With higher ranks means higher responsibility. https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/gvie9t/vocations_for_pes_e9_other_than/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf 1.Cyber nsf but their intake is rather small\\n2.

Just apply for the scholarship now. You will probably start undergoing NDU training first but will intermittently be pulled out for ME and scholarship interviews. Once you are confirmed for the ME scheme they will post you out of NDU completely and you will be at some air base, waiting for your OCS (ME) course to start. The switch happens after bmt ? Alright, thanks I think if your reason for signing on is to \"travel around the world on navy ships\", it is very superficial, and you have no idea what naval divers go through. bro I think we really cannot ans this. I think alot of naval diver info is confidential as per my understanding Call navy recruitment Center bro its not really the reason, just a question. if i wanted to \"travel around the world on navy ships\" id just partake in a midmanship. I just want to know if ill be leaving my family for long periods of time before i decided to sign on i understand. I can call the navy directly i guess. Thanks haha didnt think about that. Thank you. For NSmen, no. If something happens, the backlash would be incredible. PAP doesn\\'t have the political capital for that.        \\n\\nFor people who signed on, they do get sent on UN peacekeeping missions. Actual warzones, in flash-points all around the world. To my knowledge, SG peacekeepers are always stationed far from all the action, so there has been no casualties thus far. I\\'m not sure if they even had a chance to fire a shot. no Army no unless you regular. NSF closest to combat is navy. No. So regular got go war? Yeah adf or SF, people were deployed to Afghanistan I think, about a decade ago. Oh i see. Not anymore? Also SF you special forces? Don\\'t know any current deployments. Yes SF is special forces. most likely manpower shortage.. Bro I dk how to answer leh. We wun know why Best guess, manpower shortage Manpower shortage? Superiors didn’t like you? Myriad of possible answers that you can’t get from the internet. You are weird as fuck There’s no such thing. Are you that horny? I was in raven company for the intake in March. Raven company has a platoon full of girls, it was cool :D When you are inside, no wearing of civilian clothes. How many sets they give you, I\\'m not sure but also no choice but to rotate used clothes or wash your clothes. Some of my friends don\\'t wash them cause lazy or little admin time. So I guess when you have admin time, use it to wash your clothes instead of using your phone so you have fresh clothes to change into. nan 3 sets admin 2 sets PT, don\\'t bother bringing another set of civilian clothes And also try not to over-pack coz they’ll be giving u a massive field pack and duffel bag which u have to carry along with your civilian bag to and fro from locations to your bunk. Basically, it’s gonna be tiring af. Hey man what time are you enlisting on the 28th of September? Mono 1sir? I would recommend bringing in 1-2 pairs of comfortable home clothes to wear at night. Helped me as I could use my admin and pt pairs for more days than my peers.\\n\\nFor PT ( or any friekin activity), you have to wear your admin/pt/no 4 uniform with shoes ( sports/ combat boots). will they provide us a pail to wash our stuff? wtf 16, means 19 days inside camp?? gggg then if not enough to wear throughout the day, how sia? wait whats inside the massive field pack and duffel bah sia? oh shit man 8.45am sia :( dun know whats that Yes nan I had 18 day confinement too, it’ll feel horrible the first few days but it gets better. Just push on :-) 29 sept, 18 days here. Feelz. Haha bro just wear 1 set admin and pt throughout the day, the next day change the the second set and at night go wash. Third day can dry and wash the first 2. Pt kit can reuse once or twice with febreeze Boots, shoes, utility pouches and belt, helmet etc. Everything u need is in there my batch (mono 1sir) pop this friday boys! oh ya is Febreze impt to bring in? HAHA SHIT LA FML wah bro i 1 more day than you :))))) Feels bad for us man.... Yup, snake brand powder too They do to a certain extend. But there are still numerous people from ITE that enter There’s an IQ and personality test during the Vocation Assessment, they mainly chose from there instead of education. (As seen from the A level batch enlisting before receiving their results) Source? This is true I am, currently still serving in helldon camp :), poly batch will have a few from ite. I think jc batch maybe 1-3? ? From the people who have seen ite commandos or have commando friends Both Both But if u don’t get into commando u can still choose to sign on commandos during BMT. Its not a qn haha i meant to say that is the source. ??? is for his comment Ah i see thanks man!!!!!!!! 👍 I thought commandos is only mono? Yes but still can sign on (apply) during your BMT if you are not in mono commando BMT . Whether they accept you is another thing. o interesting You’ll have to go through a few courses (one of them being Rangers and I believe you know what the other is.) in order to be considered a regular Commando. Requirements for regulars and nsfs are different.\\n\\nPs, did not expect to stumble upon your reddit account here :p Just prepare yr items and maybe a spare set of uniform in camp so u can go camp n change and report in almost anyth\\nThere shld be some form of communication abt the mob manning tho so just look out i guess Before ORD also have mob manning. In my active days, I had 2. But luckily both never kena activate. Mob manning unfortunately applies to everyone, even NSFs once in unit,  until you ROD 🤧 ( however, if you’re lucky, you won’t get activated :D ) How do you not have a superior? My direct superior is technically my CO, but I don\\'t see him every week, and I don\\'t want to call him just for this.\\n\\nBut I\\'m just wondering how I have mob manning because I didn\\'t think it would happen until after ORD 7 hours yes, toilet is one of the best in saf. BMT is holiday compared to ocs ah but it rly depends which wing u go Training in OCS is a different league than in Tekong. You have tons of outfields to go, almost like every week go once that kind of thing. Physically and mentally demanding. I know a few that wants to OOC, not because they cannot handle the physicality but because it’s too mentally demanding. You will start to compare yourself in OCS, and others living as a man in other vocation and wonder if everything you’re doing is worth it. Honestly, if you don’t plan to sign on as a regular, going through OCS with the mindset of wanting to become upz is not worth it. You need to have the passion and desire to lead people then I’d say go for it. \\n\\nYou no longer have to queue to shower or shit anymore, there are a lot of cubicles. Oh and you will love the bunks here Didn\\'t go through OCS but I heard from PC in BMT that yes the 7 hours is a thing but they allowed cadets to self study past the lights out time so I guess the 7 hours isn\\'t enforced as much. And as he said before, you probably would need to stay up and study or plan the missions etc Tbh just be prepared to chiong sua the next 2 years Officer Cadet School is shiong, no doubt but batches and batches of cadets commission from it, so it is not impossible. Physical intensity wise, it is far tougher than BMT, much much tougher, but training is still progressive, they won\\'t make you do insane stuff right off the bat.\\n\\n7 hours of uninterrupted rest is only enforced at times when there is a conduct the next day, like an outfield or PT session. If not, you CAN get turned out in the middle of the night. Also when you are on outfield missions, there is no such thing as 7 hours of uninterrupted rest.\\n\\nSide note if you happen to get posted to MIDS Wing (Navy), there is no lights out timing, cadets can spend the whole entire night studying - which is why MIDS wing has this famous saying of \"lighthouse\", because the lights never turn off in MIDS Wing.\\n\\nThe only time you get the 7 hours when outfield is during section/platoon training, or NAVEX (navigation exercises), where you manage your own time (though you have to report sitrep in the morning so you can\\'t really just toh).\\n\\nWhen your outfields turn into missions, there is no 7 hours. I fondly remember my Taiwan EX Starlight, in one of the many different exercises, a 5d4n outfield, the amount of continuous sleep at max is 2hrs - though I managed to get some shut eye during \"Stand-to\", prone and juz toh until someone kicks your leg. Mission appointment holders tend to only have at most 3hrs of sleep in the span of the entire 5 days.\\n\\nPersonally, as I have only been through Infantry OCC, the total amount of days I spent outfield (I actually counted) is 60 days. That is 2 whole months being out in the field as a trainee. This is not counting the time after you commission and become an officer, you will still have to go outfield with your unit - but it depends on what appointment and posting you get.\\n\\nShower and toilets are wayyyyyyy better than BMTC. This is because the structure of OCS is newer as it was built later than BMTC and that people take good care of the facilities there - reporting it quickly when they find damages. Area cleaning 100% is really 100% spotless kind, cadets are expected to hold the highest level of standard during standby area. You can even akin the toilets to being HOTEL level cleanliness when ready for inspection.\\n\\nRegimentation wise, it is always held to the highest standards. Officer Cadets are really the LOWEST lifeforms in the SAF. You can expect the punishments to be very creative and can sometimes be very miserable, BMTC has the limit of punishments based on the IPS system, but in OCS the fuckening can last for longggggggg longgggg time. My friends from Sierra Wing describes their fuckening as the 45 minutes of hell - basically non-stop whacking in the training shed for 45 minutes. My platoon mate once got threatened by my instructor to write a 5000 words essay, each letter different colour for the platoon\\'s fuck up - yeah, morale can get really low in OCS. You will see the good, the bad and the ugly in people in OCS. Comparing with your peers are always almost impossible and toxicity can exist in the highest levels like openly chatting shit about someone in the section/platoon/wing. However, the flip side is that you can also find brothers that care for people.\\n\\nBut like what my instructor once said \"you are experiencing this kind of pain and suffering right now, so those who are under you in the future won\\'t have to suffer this kind of pain\".\\n\\nMy advice to you if you are looking to want to go to command school, ask yourself why do you want to be a specialist or an officer? You are expected to carry yourself throughout NS, people will look up to you for instructions and go to you all the time. You will need to juggle the expectations from the higher ups (OC, CO, etc.) as well as the wellbeing and welfare of your men (your PS, sec comms and men). Don\\'t be an officer or a specialist for the wrong reasons - such as the higher pay or the prestige, because if you have the wrong motivations and when you discover it is all not butterflies and fluffy clouds, your NS experience will be very miserable.\\n\\nP.S. Oh don\\'t forget, after ORDing, your ORNS 10 years you will still have to do what your rank allows you to do. It is not just the 2 years. Meanwhile scs is paradise compared to bmt and ocs Start:\\nIt was a huge jump from BMT as we were like thrown into this institute and little to no instructions were pumped to us. We were instantly punished for SDM stuff and downed a lot on the first day. I can tell you that the whole damn platoon had really Low morale and we just wanted to leave. Many OOCed and it really made us quite tempted to do so too. Marching has to be on point, discipline is really like uptight, admin time sometimes is just really close to <1 hour per day. I think that in the beginning, what made me dread OCS was the discipline and how you will get punished for the smallest things because my instructors were super strict about the smallest things.\\nFacilities:\\nEverything is on point here, 7 hours is a must and the toilets here are Gucci. It’ll be a huge step up from BMT.\\nService term:\\nThe PT sessions here are essentially free, we can have back to back daily workouts and we will barely have like time to even rest up for the next conduct. It really makes you on the ball as fk as they can call you down anytime for anything. There are days where we would have tests, PTs and then lessons which made us really really tired. Some days you wake up and you ask yourself why are you still in this shitty place. Outfield is every 2 weeks and force prep is super super stringent here. We were mostly called down by some alarm and we have to pack everything according to the standardisation. In OCS, If one person fks up, the whole platoon gets it. The only thing that keeps you going is the people around you. In OCS, people are motivated af and you will get reeled into the good vibes and CHIONG also. You’ll eventually start laughing even when you get fked pretty badly. \\nExcercises:\\nIn OCS, we have excercises every 2 weeks\\nEX skylark/nightbird - navigation\\nEX cocoon - section fighting training \\nEX centipede - section fighting assessment\\nEX dump in - platoon attack/defence mission\\nEX coyote  - urban ops training\\nEX relentless - navigation/jungle survival/fighting\\n\\n(These are the major exercises)\\nThe outfield here is objectively driven. For my wing, ALPHA WING (P2 121/20), it’s tradition to have Charlie mikes (continue mission) after some missions to train us mentally. For example, after centipede, we went up the bus just to wake up at Lim Chu Kang where we had to tactically March like 5km back and 1km before we reached the finishing line, we got sniper ambushed and had to transport casualties back, we then received  out wing formation patch where we are inoculated into alpha wing. Excercises are tough and many will suffer injuries, most commonly the knees, and many will Toh, but you just have to be mentally fit enough to keep pressing on.\\nRounding it off:\\nNgl OCS is tough, although not mentally and physically for me, the disciplinary part to me is really really stupid and I hate it. But after a few weeks, you will learn to just suck thumb and carry on, it really gets easier after that. The most important thing in OCS is your platoon mates, they will be the one to push you on. When you survive without 2 nights of sleep in EX dump in due to continuous digging or when you have to do 6 fire fights per day for 3 days straight, it really eats into your psyche and the only thing that pushes you on is the people around you. You will start loving and appreciating those back home and appreciating outside food. OCS tempers your mental resilience through shitty times. But push on really, it’s tough but it’ll be worth it. I didn’t stay for pro term as I got posted out, but the brotherhood in Alpha is something that I’ll never forget. nan http://officercadetschoolsingapore.blogspot.com/2015/01/preamblethis-post-is-one-that-is.html\\n\\nThis sums it up nicely.\\n\\nMy personal opinion is to go for it. First day the best day\\n\\nRmb pack your 10 pack In a way, you don\\'t really get to choose.  You actually get chosen.  and the initial lot of chosen ones will be place in enhance leadership batch.\\n\\nJust serve BMT and be yourself, and your performance and peer interaction etc will determine which command school you will go to or non at all, and if OCS require that cadets only have 4 hours sleep, and the whole wing share 1 single shower cubicle..  They will shape and train you to adapt to the environment.  but of course, in reality, they make sure you have enough sleep, and feeds you really well, and facility really is very good.. I went through OCS in 2007. Not sure if anything has changed (i doubt it has) but AIR WING is really the easiest. I was in Hotel wing for about 2 weeks then the PCs asked us to \"express interest\" to join Navy or Air Force Wings. \\n\\nso the story goes that I was sent to Air wing.\\n\\nTraining was still shiong but compared to the other wings it was very relaxed.\\n\\n I remember using the computer in my bunk and eating my uncle toby fruit bar (not supposed to eat in bunk but no one cared in air wing) and we watched Golf Wing march the whole night. Damn poor thing. \\n\\nWe actually got irritated that the noise downstairs disturbed our sleep. hahahaha\\n\\nNavy wing was next to us and every morning they ring the fucking bell while we still lying in bed. \\n\\nImportantly, Air Wing used to book out on Friday night while the other wings booked out on Saturday. Sometimes if the instructors wanna be bastard, they can drag your book out time till Sat evening. Air wing really no such fuckery, friday night confirm will book out because Air Wing PCs (who were 2 NSFs during my time) also wanna go home. \\n\\nBasically, if you go to OCS, aim for Air Wing if you can. Just my two cents worth.\\n\\nFacilities wise,OCS is good.they will drill into you that you are there to be grilled and trained as a commander\\nThe training will really built up your real physical fitness and combat fitness.Tri service and Service term still ok.Once you hit Pro term,that is when your mental need to be strong.Just enjoy the journey if you do make.it to OCS. Pro term everything goes.hahaha. Turnout at 3 am in full battle order was a norm for us back then.haha But again,things may have change cause i was batch 37 year 1999. Was in Infantry vocation and was in Alpha Wing back then.Those days,they call Alpha Wing the Sadist Wing.hahahah. Instructors was super on and will drained you(physically and mentally).But it was all worth it.You came out stronger mentallly. All the best i see \\\\~ thanks! Ooo whats special about the bunks :o and the toilets are nice? ahh i see... I assume you were posted as man? how do you think your experience compare to BMT? One correction is that the 7 hours is mostly enforced. Refer to u/rayneraiku post for the breakdown where the 7 hours is not applicable. In my case staying up past lights out is a no go and we\\'ll get F-ed for that. So it may actually be wing/company dependent depends tbh, if lucky can get posted to do admin jobs. even infantry can get posted to force protection squadrons etc. and basically zuobo for rest of NS but have to chiongsua OCS first regardless of whether I get command school or not? Really? What about it is better? thanks so much for your detailed response!! really helps me in deciding whether OCS is for me :) *air raid sirens* ---> ptsd intensifies HAHAHAHAHA thankss so much atb mannn What if you become officer then down pes, will you still keep your rank? What’s the 9th core value? you only share a bunk with another person so only two cadets in one room. the toilet was an eye-opener to me after experiencing tekong cos rly q clean I was 04/20 batch, enhanced leadership. Honestly wanted to get to command sch but didn\\'t happen so currently a combat medic trainee. Right now as trainee is so much slack compared to bmt even the pt conducts here are nothing, we do metabolic circuit without the jumping jacks between exercises. But different places may differ, I have sections mates saying some are quite shag having SOC etc. But I think if you get any combat fit vocation, you\\'ll have to go through more training for the vocation, eg the medic course is 12 weeks long, other courses may differ so its basically bmt again but less strenuous and more studying here. Sleep wise is so much better than bmt, here we LP at 1900 LO 2230, between that is all admin time so you can sleep earlier if you want ya FP pc is the best rly slack, even if go 8sit mainly do admin everything. \\n\\nTraining wise scs is shorter than ocs, personally I can’t imagine going through 9 months of intense training but ~4-5 months sergeant course for me was ok. \\n\\nIn scs there are more opportunities for you to lead and train your leadership skills. As trainers are also prev batch scs cadets they know what you go through, and are mostly very friendly. \\n\\nIn my term everyone gets to be a sect comm for a few weeks, some get chosen to be “oc” or “sm” to come up with the routine order, and plan for the day. In my opinion this really helps hone your leadership skills. \\n\\nTraining wise found term you do normal infantry stuff, stuff like basic navi, cqb, sect movement etc then pro term you will specialise in your vocation training. \\n\\nHowever I went through scs during covid period so training was extremely dialed down, so maybe it was paradise only for that period lol\\n\\nDon’t forget that 3sg rank privilege and pay :::D (I’m just kidding don’t cancel me) \\n\\n“Treat your men as you would your beloved sons, and they will follow you to the deepest valley” - Sun Tzu, this quote was hung by my sir along with his portrait when he stepped down from his position What is air raid compared to thunder flash outfield nan ahh i see ive read somewhere that if i dont go command school, whichever vocation i eventually get mostly depends on manpower needs do you think its truee thank you for your reply hahahaha! May I know what vocations do ppl in SCS usually get? issit majority infantry? and what happens after you complete SCS you just doing the same thing as unit but with a higher rank right? or do all that complete SCS have to be a commander in BMTC first before going to their respective units? Haha just curious, I’m pes e and about to ord in 2 months :))))). So close but so far! hmm but do you think if I\\'m posted to another unit and not go command school, life is generally less tough? Cos I\\'m pes B1 and may get posted to other combat units that can be equally tough hahaha im not too sure... Wow what they work as and how much they earn Idk man I have a life science background so makes sense I get medic, from my bmt section the 16 of us were like scattered all over so unless you\\'re mono, you got chance to go almost anywhere many many vocations, but those who end up in infantry are in the 20-30%. You work the ground, take care of men, have more responsibilities task wise. Officers give order, you execute them. But you will buddy with officers since you work with them \\n\\nHuh? No la in fact very little get posted back to Tekong. You can get posted to a lot of places/units wherever they need manpower nan nan ahh thankss! Oh ffs. \\n\\nOfficer knock the Sgt down? In unit? \\n\\nPlease don’t spread nonsense around. What kind of officers make sgts do corporal punishment sia? Sign extra etc, yes, but not push ups that kind. one word. lepak Not combat fit, sergeant also cannot tekan. C9 no IPPT. So relax lah. Canteen Break. 4 weeks bmt, 5 weeks vocational training. Just relax. BMT will probably be the best part of your NS journey as a Pes C. After you\\'re in your unit you\\'ll miss kranji camp and the 4 hours per day you spend ironing bed and talking cock. 80% chance you’ll be sent to CSSCOM or some other supply base. Life there is slack, nothing to do. Unfurl the cot bed cos you’ll be using it daily. Then again, you might be like me, the unlucky 20% who will be posted to combat units, like OCS or SCS. I’m posted in SCS, and it’s a tough life. You still have to go outfield, stay in, and work till 9pm. Sucks cos I did all I could to attempt to get stay out vocation at CSSCOM, but what to do? Suck thumb lor... Why leh? Can tell me more? Why leh? eat, sleep, play, repeat Lets just say after 1 month of bmt u will get posted to support vocations like driver or airforce etc etc. You can search on9 for more support vocations What do you mean why leh? Its like someone say \"we are human\" and you ask \"why leh?\" I dont think PES has anything to do with camera phones haha, it rly depends on your job function, security zoning (green/red) and unit requirement/ enforcement. Regardless of PES, camera phones are allowed in any Green Zones, which should be most camps. Camera phones are only prohibited in Red Zones. It’ll usually be states which areas are red zones. This is a friendly reminder not to share any **confidential information** about a particular camp or base in posts/comments.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NationalServiceSG) if you have any questions or concerns.* as others have said, pes has absolutely nothing to do with whether camera phones. If a zone is red zone, you are not allowed to have camera phones. but if it is green zone then yes allowed. regardless of pes status Usage of camera phones are allowed if you are in Green Zone camps, not by your PES classification.\\n\\nIf you are entering Red Zone camp or ops room, you need to surrender and deposit in the lockers provided before you enter. If you are posted to a red zone camp, you might need to sandblast/remove your phone\\'s camera if you do not have a spare non-camera phone.\\n\\nGreen Zone allows camera phones to be brought in but you are still not allowed to use the camera function (Any form of military/non military photos/videos taken inside the camp premises are also included). Depends on your sir/mdm infantry B2 is everything except the most xiong - commando and guards. B2 no command school that’s for sure I thought pes b2 cant go combat vication. At most combat support like combat engineer, artillery etc 8sir trooper maybe Who say b2 cannot go? Im pes b2, my playoon sgt said normally cant go. If you do get it quite rare. Only 1 guy in my whole bmt coy got infantry trooper Not sure if I should be posting this, but whatever \\n\\nNS is something most Singaporean men experience. I don\\'t really think it\\'s worth the questions you\\'ll get for getting PES F from people in the future, and while the NS experience would not be one I would want to repeat, it\\'s not really something to just escape either. If you really must though, there are various ways to get pes F, with basically none keeping your dignity intact or something you really want.\\n\\nWays include, getting cancer or any terminal illness, doing things which only insane people would do (such as repeatedly fapping in front of your superiors and commanders even after going DB), gain some mental issues (or fake having them and convince the specialists at IMH that you have them), get crippled, etc\\n\\nAgain, not recommending you do any of that. NS may not be as bad as you think Drink lots of red bull to fake heart attack, take legit MCs which span several months, threaten to kill yourself in front of superiors. If you really want to get out of it you can, decision is up to you. Keng depression Some condition like Insomnia. And have doctors to back you up. Bro pm me Honestly, dont cause then you wont be entitled to benefits which NSFs get in the future especially if you plan on staying in Singapore From their FAQ: \"A4.\\tAll servicemen, regardless of PES status, will be eligible for selection to be 3-year or 4-year Cyber Specialists. PES A/B servicemen will not be eligible to be 2-year Cyber Operators.\"\\n\\nDo note that if you are selected, ur NS will last 3 to 4 years instead of 2.\\n\\nYou will need to sign a contract before enlistment if you are selected. That\\'s when you know you are in. What did the MO say to you? Did he at least refer you to the visiting psychiatrist? >  have submitted my specialist memo by IMH \\n\\nWhere/who did you submit it to?\\n\\n> Are they taking my memo too lightly? \\n\\nNo, despite what people like to say the Medical board doesn\\'t take medical/mental issues lightly. They follow the protocol strictly so it might seem that way.\\n\\n> I don\\'t think I can handle firearms \\n\\nNot for you to decide, For Medical board to Decide.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t know what you wanted out of posting this. But if it\\'s to ask\\n\\n> Are they taking my memo too lightly? \\n\\nAnswer is: No. Pes system I think can be found on the cmpb website where they list it out with some info. Training wise I\\'m not sure other than some Pes you are basically excused from doing anything If i’m obese and have a back pain problem,which pes will i most likely go? Depends on what the MO thinks at your pre-enlistment medical checkup.\\n\\nObese should be the BP I think\\n\\nBack problems depends on how severe, could be anywhere from B to E. From what I hear from friends, if you\\'re obese you\\'ll go into the BP batch where you\\'ll enter bmt 2 months earlier but the back pain problem need see the during medical checkup or if you got a specialist letter to be excused even better then they might give you up to Pes C9  or lower which excuses you from almost everything I believe. Best to check with the medical officer when doing pre enlistment checkup and get a specialist checkup for you back if needed Will the MO run through like a general checkup?E.g-check if high blood pressure or difficult to breathe etc Will the BMT duration and intensity be the same as lets say PES A/B?And other trainings as well Basic stuff. They take your blood for blood test to check for blood diseases I assume. Height and weight. X ray of your torso (waist to shoulders, excluding arms). Colour blindness and sight test. Blood pressure, bpm, and cardiac dysrhythmia. And there\\'s a 1 to 1 consultation where you the MO will checkup based on your declared injuries/problems. So make sure you state everything on the online questionnaire so they will know Adding on to what the other guy said; if you happen to be seeing a specialist for your back problems, prepare and bring a specialist letter/memo to your pre enlistment medical and bring up the issue (and the letter) with the MO who\\'s reviewing your medical. Duration depends. Majority is 2 months whereas BP is 4 months. Intensity may differ as some have reasons to be excused but majority should be similar. I heard that pes c9 is not even allowed to do physical activity without supervision, they were doing push ups in the bunk and got scolded when officer saw them. All these is based on my knowledge Any injections? Ah okay thanks for the heads up,may i know when is the medical checkup before enlistment? So pes BP training will be tougher since we are obese Well they stick a needle in you to get the blood but otherwise no injections They should be sending you a letter soon with the date of your pre enlistment check-up I think. If you\\'re not confident, you can call up cmpb and ask for more info. I don\\'t know for sure but from a fitness stand point it should be gradually getting harder as you become more fit. For example let\\'s say starting run is 1km then it might increase to 2km after a month. But like I said im only assuming i pestered the staff at CMPB over and over again to enlist me as early as possible and they gave me what I wanted lmao, you should too hi may i ask what you said to them? and i’m assuming you did it through phone? Congrats bro, jackpot!\\n\\nWorking environment really depends on your immediate superior/boss, some of them can be very nice to NSFs, others are just douchebags. Just learn to suck it up and get used to it if u kena such people.\\n\\nThings u can expect: Stay Out, 8-5.30 daily, great choices for food(no cookhouse, u can choose to go out for your lunch) Lucky AF Thanks bro. 🙏 But it\\'s kinda far for me I might want to request nearer camp such as khatib camp or nee soon camp but might not be apprived though let\\'s see how it goes.  I\\'m currently pes e so definitely gonna be a clerk anywhere I go so your jack pot is referring to me being a clerk or because of cmpb hq has a better environment than other places? Thanks bro but I dun understand why ?? 😅\\n\\nI\\'m a pes e clerk admin \\nExcused stay in\\nExcuse uniform\\nPlus mo say I can only be admin\\n\\nSo do you suggest if being a clerk in a camp nearer to my house is better or cmpb? You can disrupt your NS for the start of your University, wherein you return to serve your remaining service during your semester breaks.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIIRC it\\'s dependant on how you are as a soldier, and if your CO is willing to approve it.\\n\\nFor more info, ask your unit S1 about disrupting your NS when you post out after BMT (and when you have your placement in Uni already).\\n\\n[CMPB page with basic info here](https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/web/portal/cmpb/home/before-ns/disruption-for-further-studies) You\\'re my mirror batch. I enlisted in Oct 3 2017, I\\'ll ord on Aug 2 2019. It doesnt really affect tho unless you\\'re somewhere in the middle of Oct. But if that\\'s the case, you can always defer and serve the few days during your break. In that case, there’ll probably be no overlap since uni typically starts in mid-late Aug. Thanks! —> stay out\\n—> ask to be transferred because too ulu\\n\\nbruh you gotta give and take what you get. would you rather chiong for the rest of your two years? Well you have a point. Im just gonna suck it up then. I do hope the foods good tho atleast nan Btw you asa too? The bus stop is the one that is just near mandai camp 2 right? nan yes, yes it is Oh damn sorry. If I rmb correctly they usually ask those with sweaty palms to step aside, might still do or might wear gloves. Vocations they might not put you with explosives. yes, yes and most likely no. grenade isnt a veto for pop for any pes and u shldnt be eligible for vocations such as pioneer which include explosives and ordnance handling. afaik for scholarships this shldnt impact your eligibility and u could always wear gloves if needed Sorry if this sounds rude but why were you excused and where was it stated becuase I have some hearing problems in my left ear and I was given b2 but there was no excuse for me Thanks for the help man!! I have sweaty palms (hyperhidrosis).\\n\\nWhen I\\'m nervous, my touchscreen won\\'t detect my fingers. I also have issues at immigration because of the sweat. \\n\\nIts pretty shitty but I gotta live with it lol.\\n\\nI think you can check your MC status via eHealth, under the MC section which is below your PES status. Damn Damn, I’ve never heard of that, kinda wondering if I have something like that myself now. Hmm. Anyway, good thing they heard you out :) What do you want to know? Can PM me! Go up the chain of command. You can try to report sick first though. Ur CO have nothing better to do? Which unit are you at? Go get referral to psychiatrist. Get things documented. Saf doesn\\'t take things that aren\\'t official A bit late, but better late than never.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor and go to the A&E of IMH.  There\\'s no point bothering with the chain of command as if your officer commanding really wants to, he could technically just pretend that you never did anything and ignore your request(s).  At this point, it\\'s no longer about respecting military regimentation; it\\'s about your wellbeing. who is your CO? Call MINDEF hotline if all else fails. Sounds like malingering. While I don\\'t recommend malingering, if you do have an issue you\\'re concerned about, report to your MO or go to a polyclinic. If they find that there is a valid concern they will refer you to a hospital for further check ups. Enlisted into SCDF 6 weeks ago. PES B1 PTP. Training wise for PES C, shouldn’t be too tough. From what I heard, the PES C boys will be joining Bravo Company so expect the regimentation to be strict. Other than that there shouldn’t be anything to worry about. Vocations wise I don’t think there are many options available to you; admin, store that kind of stuff. The pay is $560, NSTI is quite okay actually despite being right beside the cemetery. If you’re scared just wake your buddy up when you want to go to the toilet in the middle of the night. And confinement is only one weekend, instead of two in the army. I got to walk around on an exercise with the P rail SAR21, it came attached with a bunch of extra attachments that had to do with a backpack computer. I had the chance to fire a P225 or P226? Can\\'t remember which model. I was in 6SIR, but my CO was spearheading some special initiative and thus why we got a chance to use some of this non-standard stuff. If you undergo OCS or SISPEC, you are required to be trained in all weapon systems in a Platoon, namely the SAR 21, SAR 21 M203 variant, SAW, GPMT, MATADOR and in some cases, the P226 pistol. For the SAR 21 P Rails and Optical scopes, ADF has been using that variant prominently and I believe the Commando Units inclusive of SOF have been using them too. Recon trainees gets to use AR-15, replacing sar21 GPMG gunner in reservist here. Never trained with it during NS. But I was able to pick it up quickly during ICT AND  got stuck with it. Bruh if u take MCs, will they extend the number of days you serve? A man can dream top 10000000 questions NSFs ponder about when serving HAHA Yet another bright-eyed recruit that hasn’t yet seen what the SAF has to offer. Big ambitions bro No, its just a giant populartity contest anyways, the winner will never be the most deserving. No, my company best got silver What you mean? Basically, people like you who say they want to be company best and go OCS etc before ever experiencing bmt. And how would you know I\\'m not in the middle of bmt? Or do people like you enjoy underplaying other people\\'s goal and throwing yourself pity parties? Just an innocuous comment based on past experience, but sure, feel free to get offended. Depends on your coy. If cant, just dont get caught. Best if you\\'re platoon 4, easier to secretly buy. Looking at your previous comments, you have already POP’ed. So why still ask these stupid & redundant questions ? Anything also can do, just don’t get caught lo Nope, unless given permission by their Sgt nan How wouldn’t I not understand? I enlisted 2 months ago and you don’t see me asking on this subreddit relatively stupid questions such as if it’s ok to hand wash my clothes in camp. This is new level of idiocy but oh well. 5D4N might just be the duration of the outfield. There is still recovery process such as cleaning equipments and arms. So might bookout on Saturday if all goes well. Okay thank you!! :) Go to your superior after you get posted to vocational school. Whilst you are able to claim back the leave if you take MC during your leave, i’m not sure if that applies to block leave. When did you enlist? I doubt you\\'ll get one day off cause its on your block leave. Highly unrecommended unless you want to give off a bad impression to your superiors - it is block leave just leave it it’s 670+175 totaling for 845. am currently an scs cadet in pro term Should be 720 because no vocation yet pro term and found term same pay? also isn’t the base allowance for scs cadet 720 now With vocation? depends on vocation still. but i’m in MP so the vocation pay is the same as foundation term that includes the 50 base vocation allowance everyone gets. i separated the vocation allowance and the rank pay Then add voc pay la oh so u also got 845 during found term? well mine FT was before the pay increase but during FT i received 750 which was rank pay + vocation pay. since the pay increase it will now be 845. this is because in FT your vocation allowance is considered combat support. Oh .. okok thanks :-) Well a month back I had a conduct with C4I military experts and yes one of them was pes C9 so I believe it is possible. He was a me4 cadet as well. I\\'m in a CSSCOM unit and I know quite a few regulars that are PES C9 under the ME scheme. Although I\\'m not too sure about promoting to officer through the scheme, since none of the ME4 and up (basically CPT equivalent and above) that I know are combat unfit. If you are set on signing on, you can choose to up pes. If you declare interest in signing on and your reason for pes C is quite mild, SAF can try to see if they can up oes you. My friend is E9 and he signed on C4i, and yea he’s ME All PES can sign on C4X which is ME scheme. You’ll go to OCS and get ME4-T rank I believe (or OCT), and excused the things you can’t do due to health concerns but still pass out commissioned. Hello! Thanks for the reply! This is really helpful; I will go and look more into this as an option. That\\'s dependent on a degree, no? Hello! Thanks for the reply. Hmm, I’m sure that holding a degree allows for one to go straight to ME4-T, but nonetheless I will read it up more, thanks again! Hello! Thanks for the reply. I do see upping PES as an option, but I have several considerations as well.\\n\\n1) If I up Pes now, I will have to re BMT and my two years will reset (wouldn’t matter if i wanted to sign on, but better to err on the side of caution)\\n\\n2) I’ll have to wait for a few months for medical board to get back to me which is something I’m not really keen on as I’ll be stuck nowhere here or there (continuing what I’m doing as a C9) Hello! Thanks for the reply. Wow, this is a first and will definitely interest my E1 and E9 friends. Thanks so much! Hello, thanks for the reply! I have no excuses at the moment, and this reply really helps because it does sound like I will still be able to go through what many combat fit people can in C4X if I’m keen 🤔 Yeah, but OP said he was gonna get one so I mentioned it. Although I think they do have to go through some form of OCS to get ME4, which might give problems for him. If you\\'re already an NSF, your ORD can\\'t be shifted. I have seniors who re bmt four months before they ORD, after their POP they went back to unit to serve one more month before ORD. Basically no IPPT and SOC/VOC, no ATP if you didn’t do BTP. I think C4X scheme doesn’t automatically come with degree funding, although you can “combine” it with one of SAF’s scholarships. Degree not a must I believe but it affects pay There is a minimum term of engagement for both officers and specialists. If you enter OCS/SCS normally (i.e. straight from BMT), your length of service should not be different from your batchmates. However, if you OOC and recourse OCS/SCS on the other hand, you might face a situation whereby you\\'ll need to VES (voluntary extension of service) to pass out from your course. Everyone has 10 cycles of ICT (10 years of reservist)   \\nNon officers do 10 cycles or turn 40 years old, whichever comes first. Officers age limit is 50. KAHs need to complete 13 cycles. Everyone else is 10 cycles. Short Answer: No.\\nSCS requires combat fit and a certain ippt standard. They being said, there are still such things as admin specs, although I dont really know how to get it. Being pes c usually means that you will get posted to a non combat role after pop. C4i specs but you need be top 10% of ur cohort If you achieve the top 10% in some vocational courses (admin, supply, transport) you can receive a 3rd SGT rank. Not for supply and transport, only asa can. Top 10 go become spec trainer for future asa batches OR pass interview to be come paracounsellor P.A, free 3sgt also\\n\\nThis only applies to vocational training during pes c/e bmt Depends really, what’s your vocation? tpt opr Post to unit, wait for driver course. While waiting for driver course do Sai Kang. Finish driver course, become a driver. what is saikang? Literally translates to “ shit jobs “, basically stores, admin whatever ad hoc nonsense jobs your superiors need help with. Part and parcel of ns tho. the saikang stay in or stay out? https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/dtsxzf/what_vocations_for_pes_c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf storeman,driver, asa are very common vocations Considering signing on also. U mono armour ? My buddy also got offered the work study diploma, to me it seems not bad. 3-4 yrs to complete NS, get diploma, get hands on experience and working at the same time. nan Work study diploma which is from ITE/Poly is it? Go ahead if you wish to take up the studies and advance in the career. too bad for me i was rejected by them few days ago. I am an AFEM in 9AELG doing non-AC stuff, so if you go AC side, it will be different\\n\\n1) ME1-1 to 1-2 is given, takes about 1 year due to its criteria of time in rank, but 1-2 to 2-1 is something you have to work hard for since you are competing with all the 1-2s\\n\\n2) For me, my work here is mostly chill, spend most of our time doing secondary appointments, primary appointments only when we have system faults that we need to attend to, or to do some analysis of the faults. If you are thrown to a new system, then good luck, everyone is just slightly more knowledgeable than you in the system\\n\\nCulture wise for my side, air force is very safety focus, we will pause works if there is just a near miss (almost accident but never kenna). My seniors are quite helpful and the commanders are quite friendly and they recognises who are putting in work. But when you enter unit, be prepared to study up on your system since that is your primary appointment, if cannot answer just say I cannot confirm let me go look it up. System stuff try not to smoke so much, don\\'t know just say, chances are the person asking you also don\\'t know. Be proactive about learning different skills, and see if you can use the skills you learn put toward innovation since air force is very much into innovation nowadays. If vou able to, your write up will be quite postive.\\n\\n3) Yes, but i have not gone on any overseas attachment yet, my seniors gone for like 2 weeks for exercise.\\n\\n4) This one i cannot comment. mono 1sir bro WSDIP minimum 3 yrs right ? woah thats cool bro. mind telling me what type of questions were asked because im pretty nervous for the interview most probably from ite and do you mind sharing me what went down during the interview? thank you so much for this response!!! really answered my questions and i really appreciate it nan I took a MAPAS test at cmpb but i tot it might be for future vocation since i in mono intake . Supposedly to do Interview at cmpb after pop but they told me that i didnt pass the requirements so i enquired with SAF side becos i also choose SAF , so they told me this MAPAS test might have to do something with AF. \\n\\nJust a note that i am a ex graduate for ITE TED Diploma and they still have trouble accepting TED as a diploma so they will take ur Highest Qualification which is Higher Nitec and you will be posted as a airforce technician and you might earn lesser but since they are willing to take in WSDip from ITE then shldnt be a problem for you. thank you! ill try my best !! What\\'s the mapas test? I\\'m also going for the wsdip In RSAF interview next week. The same test of what u did for ur NS Check up.\\nI believe RSAF is looking at ur mapas test because i believe i didnt do well thus they did not accept me.\\n\\nUpdate : i have been accepted as a regular for SAF maintenance unit. Btw can I ask what questions did they ask you for the interview? I am not so sure... mine was applied at the talk, if u are selected then they will interview u imo. Muslims can keep keep their mustache, but not beards. Mustache must also be properly maintained. However all depends on OC, if no means no, I have heard of someone getting getting a letter from MUIS for an excuse and he got it. \\n\\nMuslims in the army tend to be close-knit, depending on your company. My company in BMT required Muslims to go to a different cookhouse for Muslim food and needless to say, the entire Muslim recruits will march there, along the way you tend to make friends from other platoons which otherwise you wouldn\\'t meet if you weren\\'t Muslim. \\n\\nYou will miss prayers if you are not careful with your time. There will certainly be enough admin time to do prayers, but asar time is the easiest to miss due to PT/Training. Had a really religious dude who prayed even in outfield. \\n\\nGenerally, do know that your commanders may not be muslim, so you will need to explain to them everything if need be. They tend to be more compromising on religious matters but please don\\'t take it for granted and get your obligations done as soon as possible. \\n\\nYou will meet people from all walks of life, the good and the bad. Don\\'t be a burden and your nsf life is literally easy, everybody is tired at the end of the day and they could care less about you unless you\\'re giving them trouble If you keep deferring because of studies, no one has the right to say anything or create some sort of suggestion to the actual people in charge that you will get into a \"shit\" unit. Unless, of course you are just using every chance to escape for a little bit more civilian time.\\n\\nIt\\'s just a matter of luck a lot of the time especially if you will be one of those who let the system roll the dice for them like most people. My brother sort of changed his own fate by going through the commando selection process before he enlisted but even then you can drop out among other things. \\n\\nI am enlisting soon and I feel that even if I\\'m unlucky by getting a shitty vocation, I think the people you meet and the officers you are under play a very big role into whether it really is a \"shitty\" unit on the inside if you know what I mean. >I\\'m of the opinion that the beard for a muslim is obligatory\\n\\nI adhere to the Shaffie school of thought in Islam, which is the most common among Malay Muslims in Singapore, and I have not heard of this rule at all. Do you adhere to a different Islamic school of thought? if indian muslim get scdf/spf or some infantry unit almost always Have you seen uniformed personnel keeping beards?\\nNo because it\\'s not allowed, moustache can but can\\'t be beyond the lips.\\n\\nFor prayers if you have free time then can go but it\\'s not guaranteed. Can\\'t always allocate time in the schedule for a group to pray. And don\\'t abuse it if you\\'re given time to pray. My friend deferred from ite as a cdo, post poly still cdo, so is very random. im guessing since commandos very small, they can agak2 who the in charges will be? Hence why they know the kind of people who will be in charge of your deffered unit?\\n\\nI agree the commanders play a big role. I heard of NS stories where the platoon sergeants don\\'t even shout at the platoon and they really respected him. Hope you and i get sergeant like that haha Official position of Shaffis is beard is recommended, other schools and alternative Shaffi opinions say it\\'s obligatory. We don\\'t actually have to stick to one madhab for every particular rule/hukum. When we do our research about each imam\\'s understanding and opinion regarding an issue, especially the state of the hadith, we can sort of \"tell\" which one seems to be the strongest and more secure opinion. (tell isn\\'t a good word. my vocab not so good)\\n\\nIn this case, i think imam hanbali\\'s opinion is strongest regarding the beard they scared we radicalise then use their training against them or what? No... Not at all. My brother busted his ass and he is still busting his ass for his unit. In fact, from what he tells me, his higher ups are all amplified versions of any other unit\\'s most strict and demanding higher ups.\\n\\nI would say it depends.. It is actually really obvious when someone in charge does not know how to be in charge and also does not take care of their men properly. Like already mentioned in this thread, you will meet the good and the bad but it is mostly the bad that make it unbearable and define the unit itself as shitty, not the unit\\'s work because actually pretty much every vocation has its\\' own set of challenges. Out of curiosity... why need to keep beard? yea they scared when war with malaysia, some of us go to the other side\\n\\nits a retarded reason but it is what it is, im in scdf my bro from some unit in army no one even really knows about\\n\\nyou see how many malays/muslims in navy/air force/signals tells you all you need to know already,  sg racist as fuck when it comes to ns Dang how bad just how bad is ur brother commanders like got examples/stories Religious aspect, the prophet commanded us to keep the beard according to some reports. Also to refrain from looking like the fire worshippers who shave the beards and keep the mustache.\\n\\nHealth wise, it keeps outer particles from entering your nose, much like how your nose hair filters out dust and other particles from entering your system, the beard is a bigger extra filter\\n\\nDecreased chances of facial issues such as acne, etc. The beard retains moisture in the face.\\n\\npsychological aspect, people tend to trust men who have beards than those who don\\'t.\\n\\nLastly, beards are exclusive to men and only women don\\'t have beards. Not to mention a soldier with a beard is badass as hell!\\n\\n(learn more about health benefits of beard from youtube video titled \"health benefits of beards\") when were you enlisted? I know it doesn\\'t really matter as it\\'s also not confirmed i will enter, but i was invited for commandos vocational assessment and saw a few malay guys too. But actually they also had a questionnaire regarding religion though. So i think they\\'ll keep a lookout for the guys that are religious. It\\'s the paper you get when you first enlist to BMT. I think the officer/commander paper. Got few questions regarding religion The best example is how much shorter his weekends are compared to others. He only gets like one and a half days to be at home. Other people in other units get 2 days and sometimes slightly more. last year april\\n\\n\\n commando not really a sensitive unit tho, it has few malays but indian muslim quite rare, its just xiong af not what i would consider a sensitive unit, they are just infantry on steroids Wtf why tho?? If my highest education is ITE, does it impact whether i go CD or army? I think I\\'d rather army than CD. CD sounds like a lot of hard work and claustrophobic yea i think you have a higher chance of gg cd, we do have the most ite cert holders no offence. if u go army probably get mono infantry which is dog life pretty much nan Can any vocation one. I thought I B1 will kanna infantry but got rsaf What ya mean by security clearance is Cat 2A and above PRs, as far as I understand, can’t go into either the RSN or the RSAF. nan Ah didn\\'t know that.\\n\\nWell he wouldn\\'t want rsaf anyway Alright thanks I would wanna go rsaf This toxic narrative really needs to stop. As long as you served the 2 years of NS, you will not be disadvantaged in any way. Ya. When i go buy a HDB, they ask for my pes status and what i did in my ns. Did i shoot my guns well? Am i gold for IPPT? Did i stole someone\\'s snack during field camp? Did i cheat the quiz that they told us to do? Like the other redditors have commented, PES E9 does not equate to you being a 2nd class citizen. Your PES Status does not affect you in any other way outside of the army. As a PES E9, likelihood of getting called up for reservist is usually close to 0% unless there is a shortage of manpower. PES A to PES E9 gets the same amount of privileges as long as you served your nation as an NSF for 1 year 10 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThat being said, if you are PES F, that is a different story as the service transcript shows the incompletion of full-time national service. PES F is the true \"2nd class citizen\" as labelled by many. Some problems a PES F will face is like you said HDB, school, employment in public sector etc. This is because of the underlying problems that renders him to be unable to serve full time NS, which usually warrants an explanation. Yeah it does matter, my brother just bought a BTO, they asked if he got marksman and his rank. Oh yeah and his IPPT results too and whether he kena pump during BMT yeap rank definitely matters outside of ns, /s School, wont affect. HDB I not sure but who can afford them anyway That’s the same as my bro!! Is this legit? Thank you for your reply! HDB ask your brother to knock it down first before he is allowed to ballot you stupid or stupid They forgot the /s, issa joke lah He pumped 20 and was asked to crunches changes push up change, prone roll change So want to confirm Okay thank you so much NCC HQ, easiest 3SG I am posted to STS as supply supervisor As supply Sgt. But the course there is super long, found term is easier but dreadful, as long as SCS FT, then another one month training, den posted out for 4 months On job training, den go to Kranji camp 1.5 month for Pro term. U will get private pay all along and u do Sgt course shit until pro term then u can scs pay. Not worth. So I ooc from sts. Now temporarily admin clerk So cadets who ooc scs found term without down pes will likely post here? how long does it take be 3sg pls don’t spew nonsense, most of those in NCC HQ got posted there coz they OOC from infantry pro term. even then, it’s a long shot..\\n\\nTS, PM me if you want more info \\n\\nsource: ex scs cadet U ooc from scs ft? Why? usually, or will be posted as CQMS I think in the end PES F is a big decision and likely will require medical board with you in present and an SAF specialist. Don’t think it ultimately matters whether public or private specialist memo. for me i was assigned from saf to govt hospital doc (took 1-2 months - pes E1 at the time) took another 2 months for the govt doctor to ask my MO to send me for med review at med board and took another 2-3 months before I see the MMI doctor for the review (though I saw 2 in the room - not sure if they were both docs or one was clear and the other doc) and another 1-2 months to be officially PES F\\'d by the medical board.\\n\\ngovernment bureaucracy at its finest, you need the doctors to be on the ball and hope there isnt a big queue. but generally govt is fine i never spent a penny on private since i was a poor recruit If you are asking a medical question, please ask your MO. They will be able to give you an accurate answer.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NationalServiceSG) if you have any questions or concerns.* They both hold the same power. Govt route just takes longer and they’re very quick to classify your ailments as non chronic because they don’t spare provide all the resources to make a proper diagnosis. I once requested for an mri to a specialist in sgh. He literally just shouted at me “you will never get an mri! You only get one if you’re dying!” That’s when I knew private was the only option. Wasted 7 years on Govt route and suffered in every ict. Private took 3 mths and with medical board, I got downgraded in 6 mths. Cause I have heard people saying private specialist are less reliable because they can be bought with money to write fake reports Can I pm u? Yep, that’s the more overriding feeling. If public hospital with no money-benefits for writing memo, they might trust a bit more. Sure I see thank you to see which dum dums get sent to die first Factors into your vocation posting. give u false hope Nope! Both are different organisations ask CPT Levi No, because you\\'ll need to do SAF BMT.\\n\\nI don\\'t think SPF and scdf trainees can post out after basic training. I only know SAF trainees can go to home team after BMT. Bro serious you from real police want to join “fake” police Damn that\\'s unfortunate, thanks for the reply! The only fake police is NPCC lmao Both are \"real\" police, except they govern different areas. Don\\'t make stupid comments you have no knowledge of Sign on if you want MP. SPF pay is better though, with more off days bro spf is better. also u become an infanteer for ict once u ord as mp maybe same bed I don\\'t know about chances but you can\\'t ask to be in the same platoon or not. It\\'s same as a school, you can\\'t ask the teachers to place you and ur friends in the same class just because you want to Depends on enlistment date, time and also luck. And even if y\\'all lucky enough to be same section or platoon etc. U need to be lucky enough to be same voc aft u pop lmao Btw,will we be seeing each other often? Only for the first 4 week? No Outdoor, it’s those games u play in primary school like tag Have a back injury Pm Pm Depends. They may forward this to your unit so that during reservist you will just have to see your OC to be charged. The OC will decide the level of punishment, starting from verbal reprimand to a fine. Yes. From there they will tell you where and when to report. Either CMPB or your unit HQ where a Junior Disciplinary Officer will charge you. It\\'s best if it is handled within your reservist unit because the punishment metted out seems to be more lenient compared to the officers outside of your unit If they did not forward this to my reservist unit, they will send a letter to me right? How long is the rt window? Most likely no. Block leave entitlement is only for those who pop.\\nWhen you get to your unit check with your unit if you can take leave during that time.\\n\\nOn the positive side, in unit usually u can plan your leave according to your needs with approval from your superior.\\n\\nCheck with your unit. I\\'m not too sure but I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# To be sure, check with your S1 or your PS.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEither way, if you aren\\'t allowed to join your batch mates for block leave, you aren\\'t exactly losing out. Sure they all get to run around for the period of the block leave, but you get to use the days as you wish (well, within the approval of your superiors) instead of it being locked in to the block leave period. nan Since their POP is quite far away, it is unlikely that you will still be without a unit by then. However, if it does happen, you\\'ll have to report to your company line during the block leave until your posting arrives. Usually book in morning, bookout by evening and you\\'ll just rest in the bunk the whole day. Yes, apply to CMPB asap. It should be stated in the enlistment notice you received how to contact them should you need to defer if i defer till july 6th am i guaranteed to get october intake or could it just be way after ?\\n\\n&#x200B; Honestly it depends. Usually they try to enlist you asap. Either that or they forget about you for a year... FeelsBadMan Not sure fully..but I know that you have to go to ITE for some of the courses ie pest management.\\n\\nThe outline of the course if disease and outbreak prevention. You need help, period.  You\\'re right in that you\\'re not thinking straight, and the last thing you want is for you to harm someone and potentially end up in jail for your actions.\\n\\nHowever, seeing that there\\'s no use complaining to your superiors now that someone (presumably one of your superiors) has told you that \"\\\\[you cannot\\\\] report sick outside\", my advice for you is to just not give a damn as to what your superiors say and seek the help you need (yes, I\\'m telling you to skip the chain of command).  Your own mental wellbeing is more important than what someone else says about you \"malingering\"; if they want to keep up with the latter and berate you for seeking the help you need, get your parents involved or even your doctor(s).  Have your parents call your company\\'s hotline and complain about their refusal to let you take care of yourself, or if you\\'re visiting the medical officers, provide them with the contact information of your psychiatrist if they have a problem.\\n\\nI know this isn\\'t much, but **please, please** don\\'t do anything stupid in the meantime.  I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard this many times before, but National Service only takes up two years of your life, and there\\'s a long, bright future ahead of you after this shithole; you don\\'t want to jeopardize that by doing something illegal. Firstly, the SAF takes mental issues very seriously. (Or at the least, by GOM they are bound by law to.) If you can\\'t speak to your PSes about this, go to the next level. If you can tahan speaking to your Encik, **SPEAK UP ASAP.** If not, go to your PC ASAP.\\n\\n**IF POSSIBLE, CALL UP/MEET UP WITH YOUR OUTSIDE PSYCHIATRIST AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ASAP.**\\n\\nSecondly, your PSes usually don\\'t care about that shit; they can\\'t do anything about you since you have medical leave, which is almost irrefutable unless they launch a full investigation. Which in your case, since it\\'s genuine, they will find you innocent.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDon\\'t push your luck thinking, \"Oh, I can tahan; no problem.\"\\n\\nBy the time you realise you can\\'t, it\\'s too late. \\n\\nGet help, if it comes to it you\\'d be discharged from the SAF on medical grounds; this is not weakness, it is just life and for your safety (and wellbeing).\\n\\n# SEEK HELP ASAP Maybe tell the MO Or your sergeants about your mental issues. Or get your psychiatrist to write a letter in to the office about your mental health Going to add on to this:\\n\\nIf you have a superior you think you can trust, doesn\\'t have to be your PS or PC, another platoon\\'s PS or PC also can if you feel you can\\'t trust yours, tell them that you are having these issues and that you need help. At the very least, they should help you get in contact with SAF resources which can help. At best, they can talk to your PS, PC, OC, or whoever and discuss ways that will benefit you more, be it a down pes, getting you in contact with a counsellor, etc. Don\\'t be afraid to speak up. 1. you will take a pic with your fam\\n2. you will handover your ic and get ur 11b + saf ezlink card and some other stuff\\n3. you will be escorted to a room with a batch of peope where u will wait\\n4. after waiting, you will do some admin and learn some stuff\\n5. you will be escorted to the hall\\n6. take your oath and pledge\\n7. go eat\\n8. bye bye to parents Check out the guide to BMT on /r/Singapore. At the sidebar. Adding on to what u/KrimKarma said, after your parents leave, you will be brought to your bunk, where you put on your bedsheet/pillowcase etc. Followed by collecting the equipment issued to you by the SAF (1 bigass duffel bag + 1 field pack if you are Pes C). You will bring everything up to your bunks where your sergeants will then do an equipment check to make sure you have everything and also let you try on the clothes and boots/cap to exchange for different sizes if you need. After that it\\'s just dinner and then free time until lightsout at 2200ish. pes c bmt, quit lepak, enjoy ur time there mate and make use of ur free time :)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/arvnaf/ns\\\\_bmt\\\\_at\\\\_kranji\\\\_camp\\\\_ii\\\\_for\\\\_pes\\\\_c\\\\_whats\\\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/arvnaf/ns_bmt_at_kranji_camp_ii_for_pes_c_whats_your/) Hey I’m enlisting on 17th too, have you received a packing list ? I’m still waiting and have to turn to online to see what to bring on enlistment... yeap also +1 assault pack Nope haven\\'t received any packing list letter yet tho. Enlisting on the 16th, didn\\'t you receive the letter that has the green paper with the invitation to the parent engagement session? The packing list is behind it(the one which shows the location of the camp). They issue assault packs to PES C now? I rmb it was sling bags.. Wah gg man... I think just check on the forum and bring what previous batches/bmt people bring before.\\n\\nAre you looking forward to it ? Ya just saw, thanks man ! All the best for your enlistment and see ya around ! nan nah PES C and E only get assault packs Tbf im actually quite nervous and not sure what to expect since it will be different than what the peepd in tekong experience. C9! Same ah, although what I heard and seen from the parent engagement session sounded good and seems like quite ok, I think too good to be true leh, LOL..\\n\\nWhat’s your pes status, I’m C9. nan Oh yes i too went for the parent engagement session there was this commander(i cant rmb the rank) who made some magic trick with a bell and jokes around. Seems too nice of a commander to be true hahaha.\\n\\nIm C2, do you have any excuses? I heard that theres some lucky(?) individual who gets the stay out excuses tho Hoho! See you! From what I heard its most likely we are in the same company while the 17th May one will be in the other company Sch V has. Oh boy..hahaha, I remember sia, there was 2 parents and 1 incoming nsf who went up when he asked for volunteers, hahaha, he also jokingly ‘tekan’ the guy, rip sia..\\n\\nYeah, I have a chronic skin condition, but on the portal, it’s only my pes status, no excuses like stay-in or out, I doubt my condition is serious enough to stay out, so suck it up, but I hope to catch up on some studying or reading during NS, maybe think about Uni or smt. Other company is Bravo company ? Ahh same here, no stay out excuses too and yes hopefully for the 2 years of NS i can get some studying done, been meaning to learn some foreign language.\\n\\nAnyways see ya on 17th, who knows maybe we are put into the same company or platoon Yass. Yeah man, hahaha, we can definitely gleam something from this experience, ultimately it’s what we choose to make of it that matters, so let’s make it count ! \\n\\nSee ya on 17th man, hahaha, we might be, we won’t know, but let’s go in with an open mind and see where it takes us ! lol, that\\'s funny.\\n\\nYou\\'ll get posted out no matter what. Your future depends on your PES status there after. Yes it\\'s true that if you\\'re on mc and your post is delivered to your coy, you won\\'t be posted out. This is because 1, you\\'re not physically there to be posted out and 2, units don\\'t want personnels who are currently still on mc. \\n\\nYou however will be posted out at some point so no worries there, just that the timing can range from weeks to months at the point of which you ooc/oot. This is most likely dependant on if your coy even sent out requests for post out which they most likely did, (you will know if they sent out requests if fellow oots are being posted out) or just demand is quite low at the moment.\\n\\nFor now, just tahan with the saikang or lepak lepak depending on your coy and wait. Good luck on your posting!\\n\\nSource: was former ooc who actually got posted out after my coy pop because I was on 2 months mc for a surgery I did during bmt. It\\'s been 3 months and there has been no posting and also one month no one got posted out. What\\'s wrong with my coy, all the OOTs were confused. How long after u come back from your MC did you get posted out? Has ur coy POPed? When I came back from my hospilization Leave (2 months), my coy already pop 1 month ago. So it was really just me and 1 more guy waiting in bunk at coyline for a post out. I think I only waited for 1 and a half weeks before I got posted out. Hope this helps. But the guy waiting with me was already waiting for 1 month and still no news. So in the end, it all comes down to luck and your pes status 8june Almost 3 mths not 3mths btw U\\'ll get ur vocation after ur coy POP. Since you did not complete BMT, it will not be a combat vocation at the moment. Depending on your final PES after all the checks, you\\'ll in the end re-BMT, go for the PES C BMT or go for the ASA course when the course starts. Meaning what? Meaning u most likely won\\'t be posted out until ur coy POPs If they say minimum pes is XXX and you\\'re going to downpes below XXX, then yes you will revocate. Mechanic course? As in those fix 5tons n thanks? I’m in the army now as a nsf bionix technician Mon :\\nLecture - PT - book out\\nTues:\\nLecture - bookout\\nWed:\\nLecture - pt - bookout\\nThurs:\\nLect - test - bookout\\nFriday :\\nPT - bookout\\n\\nTypical bookout time is 1730/1800hrs. The above timing only applies to ASA at Charlie. I\\'m not sure about SA timing. Btw you are in bravo coy or alpha coy now? Life will be quite relax, mostly lectures and ofc your usual lunch and dinner.\\n\\nPT will be Mon, Wed, Fri\\n\\nMight want to think of taking a book with you just in case you get bored rushing to wait and waiting to rush!\\n\\nSource: HQ staff (hi there) nan nan No difference just curious because i was from bravo coy too haha and now im in charlie asa. You platoon 1 or 2?\\n\\nYes ASA tues and Thursday is whole day Lecture. Have some admin time if lesson end early though Yep! However swimming will be in Kranji Camp III instead of Khatib Camp nan nan You in this batch of Charlie? Platoon 2, under Sgt Had-ji-so right ? Ahahaha\\n\\nGood luck man, the lectures are different because, it’s vocation training once you finish your training in bravo. Your first 4 weeks is basic military stuff, firing, throw pineapple, etc. \\n\\nIf you enter Charlie coy, you have lectures pertaining to ASA or SA stuff, but you still have foot drills, marching, because they wanna prep you for GP. Asa related nan Section 3 boi? Depends on when the next intake is, you can check on cmpb website. Can be a week to a few months There is intake next week but after that there is no date in sept or oct . Will they give me one of the dates next week? Possible but rare to give the letter this late. Just wait it out 4) Yes can, I even brought my ATB in 1. Think its an average size camp compared to others. Small compared to airbases and navy bases definitely.\\n\\n2. The cookhouse is operated by SATS. In my opinion the food’s pretty okay especially during lunch time. Not so good during dinner tho.. But i guess you can always eat at the canteen. The malay store and the chicken cutlet at ABGTC cookhouse canteen is pretty good. And its very near the guardroom too.\\n\\nCan’t answer the rest, but please do not bully when hoto duty from the guard duty personnels ;) enjoy your your stay in gedong cos its the most miserable place on earth\\n\\nSource: was from there till may’19 in one of the units there but ordloo nan see your pattern, likely want to ask about change of branch or vocation or unit Hi, it’s regarding some private matters, hope you understand thanks :)! Thanks for your input, if you have any information pls do pm me thank you :)! I thought you already talk to MO? Not yet :/.. Unfortunately, MO don’t have much power in terms of these affairs Have you ever wondered... Depends if you lost your tooth in camp/ otw to camp/ during book out etc. Alot of factors involved nan Dental implant. no. actually i havent ns yet. nan Thanks! If you don’t choose NDU, Commando or Guards during your vocation choosing, from what I’ve seen, they don’t send you there. I’m not sure about other vocations but they will try to place you in your preferred vocation unless they really need more men. kranji camp 2 is not a red zone. there\\'s even a free wireless@sg wifi there nan bro thought i already explained LOL Excuse everything and get pes f You dont tell that to Bravo Platoon 1 Platoon commander, Encik Goh will f _ _ k you upside down Minimum use of hands should be fine. But if asked to carry heavy stuff my fingers will have wider cut and bleed more. Not that I’m unable to serve the army. Still can post me out at least to ASA the heavy stuff you will be carrying throughout your bmt are just your duffel bag and sar21 rifle (if you\\'re not excused arms/heavy load) ASA need to type. Doesnt that make ur hand bleed Don’t pes f, 2nd rate citizen bro Given the condition is still good, my fingers can probably still survive. But if it goes back to worse then yes, even typing will make it bleed (happened during my poly intern) Won’t and never. Would prefer OOT and be clerk as commented by someone below. But unsure if possible Well logically speaking just go get excuse everything and try to complete the 2 months. Then its just stay out clerk life everyday and u can wear gloves when using the keyboard Get memo from specialist or doctor then show to your camp mo. Is that possible? Because even if I go NSC now my skin condition now is still good. But didn’t want to recourse lol You can try bringing gloves and wearing it during the activities if u cant get excuse? Thats the only solution i can think of. Yep, totally possible. Im a pr chinese national and had the misfortune of being posted to guards I know of an PR who was posted to guards as a platoon medic Guards can, Commando cannot. For commando VA they will call you up via a letter maybe about 4 months prior to your enlistment letter.\\n\\nYou will go to hendon camp and perform a series of activities: namely balancing, static exercises ie. sit ups, push ups and pull ups, and then interview. No. why do you consider it to be unfortunate? just curious oh okay, thank you! Chiongsua harder than infantry but get same pay. Regulars all super siao on, resulting in nsfs suffering under them. Oh and GCC/GVT + BRUNEI. I assume you want to come in because of the \\'pride\\' factor? I just really want to push myself out of the comfort zone. I read about the things one does in guards and it seemed more rigorous and intense which was quite appealing to me. Ah i see, well you\\'ll get plenty of opportunities to \\'push yourself out of the comfort zones\\' in ns (sometimes too many) regardless of what vocation u end up as! But that\\'s a really positive atititude you carry, not many people go in with that mindset. Atb to your ns journey! Just ask your MO. Still mc and tmr gonna see doc again due to my condition got wrist so hoping I can have some ways of knowing what I can expect from the mo Broke my foot in NS and It\\'s very standard for you to request a memo from your specialist, especially if you tell them you are in army. In that memo the specialist can indicate to give you X amount of time to rest and they are usually quite lenient. You will then pass this memo to your MO and they will guarantee follow that memo because it\\'s a directive. Got memo from the hospital doc mostly just state rest more eat what and what not and my mo is not those lenient one 1 time he put 1 guy for light duty but that guy still want to join back his squad for training go see specialist to say he fit from leg injury end up the doc pissed from his action and straight down pes him. So now I was curious about it due to I have a specialist appt a month from now not sure what verdict will he give . what the MO did there is understandable if that guy injury is legit one. cuz go outside u can easily beg the specialist to write whatever in the memo cuz outside ppl very kind. but in SAF if you get injured AFTER the MO give you a status then MO gonna get slaughtered by higher up.\\n\\nso for your own memo the specialist just say get more rest? didnt indicate what type of rest? eg. light duty/excuse upper arm etc.? anyway dont worry so much, if specialist say need to rest then MO bopian need to follow one. SAF very strict safety now. Tell him also you still got follow up in August then even more he will understand your condition is not fully recover yet I hope spf  mo is same as saf mo regarding safety and well being of the trainee health Elaborate pls. I don\\'t even know what the video is for or what is it roughly about, how to give u ideas on how to make a video.\\n\\nWith your post I can only tell u to take video edit and wah lah magic. “We have a East Coast Singapore, we have a together at East Coast plan..”'"

       " madhab for every particular rule/hukum. When we do our research about each imam's understanding and opinion regarding an issue, especially the state of the hadith, we can sort of &quot;tell&quot; which one seems to be the strongest and more secure opinion. (tell isn't a good word. my vocab not so good)</br></br>In this case, i think imam hanbali's opinion is strongest regarding the beard they scared we radicalise then use their training against them or what? No... Not at all. My brother busted his ass and he is still busting his ass for his unit. In fact, from what he tells me, his higher ups are all amplified versions of any other unit's most strict and demanding higher ups.</br></br>I would say it depends.. It is actually really obvious when someone in charge does not know how to be in charge and also does not take care of their men properly. Like already mentioned in this thread, you will meet the good and the bad but it is mostly the bad that make it unbearable and define the unit itself as shitty, not the unit's work because actually pretty much every vocation has its' own set of challenges. Out of curiosity... why need to keep beard? yea they scared when war with malaysia, some of us go to the other side</br></br>its a retarded reason but it is what it is, im in scdf my bro from some unit in army no one even really knows about</br></br>you see how many malays/muslims in navy/air force/signals tells you all you need to know already,  sg racist as fuck when it comes to ns Dang how bad just how bad is ur brother commanders like got examples/stories Religious aspect, the prophet commanded us to keep the beard according to some reports. Also to refrain from looking like the fire worshippers who shave the beards and keep the mustache.</br></br>Health wise, it keeps outer particles from entering your nose, much like how your nose hair filters out dust and other particles from entering your system, the beard is a bigger extra filter</br></br>Decreased chances of facial issues such as acne, etc. The beard retains moisture in the face.</br></br>psychological aspect, people tend to trust men who have beards than those who don't.</br></br>Lastly, beards are exclusive to men and only women don't have beards. Not to mention a soldier with a beard is badass as hell!</br></br>(learn more about health benefits of beard from youtube video titled &quot;health benefits of beards&quot;) when were you enlisted? I know it doesn't really matter as it's also not confirmed i will enter, but i was invited for commandos vocational assessment and saw a few malay guys too.

Your own mental wellbeing is more important than what someone else says about you &quot;malingering&quot;; if they want to keep up with the latter and berate you for seeking the help you need, get your parents involved or even your doctor(s).  Have your parents call your company's hotline and complain about their refusal to let you take care of yourself, or if you're visiting the medical officers, provide them with the contact information of your psychiatrist if they have a problem.</br></br>I know this isn't much, but **please, please** don't do anything stupid in the meantime.

Maybe u can start to look at how u can improve yourself as person.

If you think that you are unable to handle too much pressure or dont think that you want to do it at all, then being a man is perfectly fine. Remember, serving 2 years as a man can still be meaningful. It is just what you make of it. Meaningfulness is what you make of it, so don't be pressured to go to cmd sch just to get sth out of NS. I suggest you ask around for others' experiences in OCS/SCS before you make a decision. The more info you have the better a decision you can make for yourself. Also, asking whether command sch is worth it is a very personal opinion so I suggest you ask more probing questions about life there suited to your concerns so you can decide for yourself whether it is worth it. Personally, yes. Being a commander gives you more freedoms and allowances to do your things, but do note it does come with additional responsibilities.

Oh .. okok thanks :-) Well a month back I had a conduct with C4I military experts and yes one of them was pes C9 so I believe it is possible. He was a me4 cadet as well. I'm in a CSSCOM unit and I know quite a few regulars that are PES C9 under the ME scheme. Although I'm not too sure about promoting to officer through the scheme, since none of the ME4 and up (basically CPT equivalent and above) that I know are combat unfit. If you are set on signing on, you can choose to up pes. If you declare interest in signing on and your reason for pes C is quite mild, SAF can try to see if they can up oes you. My friend is E9 and he signed on C4i, and yea he’s ME All PES can sign on C4X which is ME scheme.
