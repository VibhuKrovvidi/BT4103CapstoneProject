Quote: MINDEF Services > Non-ICT IPPT/RT > FAQ > Medical Excuse and Examination  Q4 I have reached 35 years old and was informed that I need to do an \"IPPT-FFI\". What is an \"IPPT-FFI\"? \"IPPT-FFI\" was the term used to refer to the compulsory medical examination done for all IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 and above. The \"IPPT-FFI\" has been incorporated into the revised SAF Health Screening Programme which came into effect on 30 May 2011. There is no need to do a separate \"IPPT-FFI\" if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening Programme for that year.  All IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 years and above are required to complete the SAF Health Screening Programme every year before attempting IPPT. The aim of this medical screening is to detect any medical conditions which may make you unsuitable for the IPPT. You will not be allowed to take the IPPT if you are 35 years old and above and have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements for the year.  The SAF Health Screening Programme review will be initiated by your NS unit administrator when your IPPT window (birthday window) is open. You will be issued with a certificate after completion of your SAF health Screening Programme requirements. The certificate is valid until 30 day after your birthday. For example, if you are 35 years old, the certificate will be valid until (and including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday.',\n",

For the 1st year, you will just fail your ippt at the last day of your current 1st year window, and you will be asked to do RT on the second year window while your second year IPPT window opens. However, after you completed your RT session in the 2nd year, your 2nd year IPPT window is automatically cleared too. Effectively, you will only need to do RT every 2 years. I think laojiao might know what I am talking about here in the early days. If you can pass your IPPT easily, then this is probably not a topic for you. There are even ways to calculate the minimum amount of times you need to go to FCC (which includes risking and the amount of time you can get disciplinary warning from NS + the penalty cost of it). But I will not discuss this here. However, NS.sg update their system 1-2 years ago and required soldiers to attend ippt asap or else face disciplinary action for that year (in term of window). You will need to clear ippt (as pass status, or through completion of ipt/rt) for every window. So, I believe, the patch up the loophole. Actually, I think going for RT/IPT is good.

I'm working in the media industry so i've been super super swarmed with work, OT almost everyday completely forgotten about going for RT.  Will I face any serious charges if I get called to CMPB because they might assume I did not make any effort to complete my RT at all? This is my first time if I do get charged.  Please help!\",\n",
       " \"First time will be warning. When they charge you first time, can be at CMPB, or at your unit camp, or during ICT if there is an upcoming ICT. So far, I have never heard of people kenna first charge and fined. But kenna fine is the worst case scenario for first time charge. Unless you really go and shoot back at them gaolat gaolat. If you do that, you will confirm hong gan gao gao. If you get called to CMPB, its also not confirmed that you definitely will get fined. I went CMPB before to answer charge, no fine. But basically, your fate is in the hands of the officer-in-charge. If you show guai lan face and talk back, then of course kena fine or worse is a possibility. Now, after clearing the first charge, its up to you liao. If you bochup again the next year or two, of course, be prepared to face charge again and kenna fined again. If you don't want to give $ to SAF, then you must plan your RT now. If you are totally CMI case, confirm cannot pass on the 8th or 14th RT session, that means you have to go for the full 20 RT sessions. Well, actually its 17 RT and 3 RT-IPPT (8th,14th,20th). Lets say you go for the full 20 sessions. If you go once every weekend, you clear your IPPT liabilities in 20 weeks. If you can squeeze out 1 weekday, then you clear in 10 weeks. If you are getting up there in age, and very long never do exercise, never even go kick football or play bball, then I sincerely advise you to do some light workouts at home, since right now, you may not be able to book RT sessions, until you finish the charge process. Just do like 5-10 pumping. Or wake up on weekend, do like 10 minute jogging before you jiak breakfast. This is to slowly work your body into some physical shape. Thus, you reduce the risk of injury. If you suddenly do RT exercise, can get injured de. Moi tio injury during RT. Heng, I had enough time to recover, before continuing RT and passing on the 14th RT-IPPT. Ownself should ownself know own body. So take care always, think safety always. Yes, starting the RT process is super duper sian and marhuan, and really throws a kink into your schedule. Everyone knows. The only hard part is clearing your work schedule enough to start. Once you start, its very easy liao. You basically can just show face at RT, go through the motions can liao. If you want to quickly pass and avoid going more RT sessions, then of course you will have to put in effort. After you clear RT, can consider the IPT process, since its much shorter, only 10 sessions niah. RT or IPT, you still get paid. So it helps cover public transport (plus makan) totally or partially helps cover fuel costs if taking motorbike or car. Haiz, what to do? Born in SG ish like that de. NS for sinkies, jobs for FTs.
