"Very Professional People down there. Recommended⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Very patient kind respectful.. very smooth throughout the Medical Check-up."
"Unlike what the other reviews may suggest, people here were adequately friendly(like anywhere else in sg). The place is really clean and efficient"
The place overall is fine. Good experience. Just a tip if any of u going for medical checkup. DONT GO LATE OR ELSE U have to come back other day to complete the rest.
"I went there for my NS Checkup today 29 August 8am...
Here is what I went through:

Gate Entrance: Security Check & Counter,
Take a Sticker Pass and just WALK THROUGH the gate... Don't be like me...I stood there thinking I can scan the …"
"Don't bother showing up at the timing assigned to you, you'll end waiting for more than 2 hours only to realise that you're the last person in line. Doctors don't really care which is fair because they don't really have a choice but to be there. This place is a complete waste of space and time."
just here to read through the NSF reviews LOL
Takes a extremely long time due to waiting. Overall a complete waste of time.
"All staff are professional and knows what they are doing. Idk what the bad reviews is about but for my personal experience, everyone there is very helpful and take initiative to help me out."
Unfriendly staff. The guards are doing their job but the staff keep pushing them to do more stuff which they are not suppose to. Absolutely atrocious. There is one woman at the VAC who keeps changing her tone when she talks to people and threatens people to leave. She always removes her mask to talk to people to show her expressions.
staff at medical screening station 5 for height and weight is extremely rude and unfriendly
Staff were not serious; impatient. Undesirably long waiting times. Would not recommend CMPB to a friend.
Just sent my son for the pre enlistment checkup this morning.  The guard at the entrance couldn't give clear instructions.  Keep shouting when we got our son to alight since we couldn't drive further in. Hello please train your army …
One of the most inconvenient locations I have ever seen. Terrible directions. Rude staff. Expect this whole process to take hours. 100% not recommended.
"Ok lah, this review is based on my visit January 1990, so maybe sikit out of date. NSF staff was ok, typical bo chap, happy like bird to  tio a switch off vocation. MO, on the other hand, seemed si peh buay song. This is probably because he …"
"Tbh, its not that bad of a place to visit, contrary to what others are saying."
"Those enlisting here, PLEASE make sure you declare all medical conditions. severe or minor, to the Medical officer during your checkup.

If you do not believe you will fare well in combat/PES-fit BMT, do get a medical specialist letter from …"
Guards at gate very rude. Ask question they ignore you. The rest of the staff are nice and friendly though.
Overall great experience and medic was professional with blood draw
Very kind people inside CMPD medical check up. Was constantly greeted with smile and patience.
don't bully me
Meh. Staff is pretty nice.
Lousy service dk how help people. Ask question also say dont ask me not my taiji...
"[28/08/18] Tuesday
With all the negative reviews, thought I could share my quick personal opinion. Perhaps it varies from person to person, but my trip to CMPB was ultimately great and definitely a memorable experience :)!

The medical …"
Medical check up place for SAF
Me and others were treated like dirt.
"Was here for pre-enlistment screening, a few Counselling sessions & to answer a charge. Inconvenient location."
No cookhouse. NSF need to spend $$$ out of their meagre pay.
the officer attitude is not good and no patience to service. i just don't understand what that he say and he use the unfriendly tone to repeat to me with another language
Idk why so many people give negative reviews on this place went there for medical check up the staff is friendly the nsf are cool overall i had a good experience there.
The gold star of public service
Expect yourself to be waiting for at least 3hrs here for any form of meeting. Even till your really bored. Cold air conditioning no wifi
Not accessible at all.
extremely poor and rude customer service
Worst Day of My Life.
"Wooo, real edgy, ziyuan, you should be a novel writer"
Highly inaccessible. So hard to get there not near any MRT stations.
bane of my existence :(
"No cookhouse but get to book out everyday. Most troublesome thing is discussing what's for lunch.
Sidenote: 菜贩@canteen B is bad, real bad"
How do people even go to this place... Middle of nowhere..
officer talk to you like you own them money be prepared and very hard to get there like middle of a village or something
Rude staff
Inaccessible need 1h travel time to waste more of your time.
So far away in the middle of nowhere.
Very bad Security troopers who have very bad attitude towards public
in the middle out of nowhere
"Place is not well kept, people working there are unbelievably rude."
Bad service
"Interestingly enough, all the negative reviews were removed."
Bad service
So sheat! Treated like dirty pigs training to step on minefields

Great dispensary


"Great food, friendly staff. Although they seem to have a military theme going on. Just make sure to tell them you're coming beforehand; they take security seriously as you can tell by the barbed wire fencing and the signage proclaiming it to be a protected area"

Great place to have your IPPT Training. Instructors are professional.
Don’t know what to proof by doing IPPT
Did my IPPT here. Good facilities.
Note that entrance is now @ KCIII

Life of a nsman





"anyone can confirm this. I clear my FFI last yr at 35. Received another saf100 to go FFI again in march13.  i thought FFI is call up every 2 year: 35, 37, 39...  going to screw them if they anyhow call me back."
System has changed. No longer have Phase 1 and 2.
"ok.. going to be pricked by those nsf for blood test ...in the first blood test, i got poked 3 times and they still cannot extract the blood until the full time senior medic came.. 1 shot 1 kill...swee...."
lucky u lolz... i hv nvr got FFi done before..
who arrange FFI? unit?
"Wah... really must go every year liao.  Quote: MINDEF Services > Non-ICT IPPT/RT > FAQ > Medical Excuse and Examination  Q4 I have reached 35 years old and was informed that I need to do an ""IPPT-FFI"". What is an ""IPPT-FFI""? ""IPPT-FFI"" was the term used to refer to the compulsory medical examination done for all IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 and above. The ""IPPT-FFI"" has been incorporated into the revised SAF Health Screening Programme which came into effect on 30 May 2011. There is no need to do a separate ""IPPT-FFI"" if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening Programme for that year.  All IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 years and above are required to complete the SAF Health Screening Programme every year before attempting IPPT. The aim of this medical screening is to detect any medical conditions which may make you unsuitable for the IPPT. You will not be allowed to take the IPPT if you are 35 years old and above and have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements for the year.  The SAF Health Screening Programme review will be initiated by your NS unit administrator when your IPPT window (birthday window) is open. You will be issued with a certificate after completion of your SAF health Screening Programme requirements. The certificate is valid until 30 day after your birthday. For example, if you are 35 years old, the certificate will be valid until (and including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday."
"i dun think i will need to do age 35 FFI, because I will MR by age 31....."
"Do you know if you finish 10 years cycle too early, they may extend you to 15 yrs or 20 yrs cycle. For me, I did 17 years cycle to complete."
"Nah...once u in MR, won't be called up liao unless Singapore got war. U probably the only 1 to do 17 years cycle."
He think he will be MR by 31 years old. So he haven't MR yet. My whole platoon mate did > 15 years. This is common.
"Most active units will call people back once a year so they will complete in 10 years. Of cuz there are some units who only call people up every few years, that's why they will drag till they need to do FFI.  I will MR next year, so no FFI for me either."
Yeah some units only call up their servicemen either once every 2 years or once every 3 years.
"Quick question,  if I've already MR-ed and have no more IPPT/RT liabilities, I can safely ignore the HSP appointment set up for me automatically?"
Why not just call them and ask them to cancel it?
"Hmmm u may want to call up to confirm, cos it's SAF100, should not play play."
"I did not get an SAF100, just a simple email saying I have a medical appointment, that's why I'm confused.  I did call the stated number once and asked what if I forget and missed the appointment, the fella on the line said nothing will happen. Afterall what can they do to me? Fine me $X00 for not turning up?"
"If that's your case where there's no SAF100 then ok lor, probably can skip. But if it's via SAF100 where your appointment can be reimbursed for half-day makeup pay then u cannot play play."
"To add on even if we have MR, we are still liability to call up to the age of 40(WOSE) to 50(Officer) year old."
I thought MR wont call back unless war?
" The different is we are no long under our unit but inside MR list (and apart from that is we do not needs to do IPPT, only needs to standby for activation).  Unless someone needs you then dig you out from MR list to deploy you, you are safe from NS duties. "
"Very generally speaking, yes they wouldnt touch u unless got war.  Having said that, touchwood one day if s'pore got earthquake or tsunami & extra manpower required for rescue efforts, u can still be activated.  Depending on your vocation also. Like when jamban mat escaped, some active units were deployed in the manhunt & i heard got reservist units placed on standby at last minute also. If u r combat vocation chances are higher.  Having said all that, they also dont want to call u back unless no choice. Its an admin nightmare for them. If your unit stand down liao, where do they throw u? And some of your gear may not even be compatible with existing stuff e.g. I doubt the camo helmet cover can fit the old school metal helmet."
the ffi is for ippt not for deployment  but if u booked holiday b4 spf100 then u shld be able to defer no?
old thread.
where to see FFI status or cert?
"are you at least age 35?  FFI now is every year haf to do the moment u r at least 35 One tell tale sign is try booking ippt thrgh NS portal if u can book + assume u r at least 35, thats mean your FFI is cleared and good to go"
"BTW if my HSP appointment is at 9:30am but the SAF100 stated that I have to report at 8am, then we need to be at the medical centre by 8am or 9:30am?"
930am.....
early do finish.. early go back  sometimes there is a queue.... 1st come 1st serve
Calander wrote: 930am..... OK noted. Thanks a lot for your information.
every yr check one time lay.. they wan ensure if u r fit for ippt..by the way havent MR meh ?
not every year la its oni when u turn 35 onwards
Now some crazy General (NS) politician escalating situation with Malaysia maybe they will dig out the MR list liao. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFk
you have a concern about that?
Just curious only. I am definitely safe!
"For FFI now (above 35), how to book an appointment?"
Call your unit to make appointment lo  Posted from PCWX using ganyu mobile
"now no change still lah once u hit 35, it's every yr must do FFI before u can even think abt booking the IPPT/RT/IPT or the soon-to-be-launched NS FIT"
"Is it true that once a Singaporean male reaches 40 years old, he will not be called back for reservist training? What if he still has not completed the full reservist cycle?"
Depends on your unit
"So, there is no general rule or law that says once reach 40, no need to be called back, right?"
"If occifer will still need to go back, if reach 40 but still not yet complete cycle. Occifer age limit is until 45."
40 shld clear all ict liao leh  unless u keep siam
U ord at the age of 40right? For example u turn 40at 10th Jan 2016. U won't be called baxk for incamp. Egen if the rest of.your unit still have ICT?
Once they serve you letter tell you no need to go back then means no need to go back already lor. Why you so gravely concerned?  Its MINDEF. They wun forget you one.
You will receive a formal letter from Mindef....if not good luck
"If reach 40 and you still not yet complete your ICT cycle, the unit would not be calling you back. Instead they would send you a letter asking you to collect your Certificate Of Appreciation. No watch. No medals."
depends on ur rank...
Even If u never complete all cycles. U still get the 3k right. Assumeinh u hit 40
 The watch cannot make it. The COA letter bosses oso bo chup The medals oso cannot sell to Cash Converters.  so 3h gifts....keep for themselves sua rah.  Nowadays reservists ish a liability for Sinkie male. while FT males happily working and promoting.
"i 35 already give moi useless watch....  CO ask moi want to extend 5 more year with rank go staff sgt...  i told him does staff sgt give moi job outside ? he diam diam...  in my mind no pay increase , rank pay increase but i cannot see....and got chance let FT take my job...siao....  u no FT take your job doesn't mean outside same"
"Didn't know there is 3k to collect. But if a Singaporean male did not complete all cycles by 40, he does not deserve anything. Otherwise, it would be unfair to other Singaporean males who did complete."
"Max: 40 for Nsf-nsmen (regardless u completed how many cycle)  there are rare cases, this happens in my unit, that person need two more cycle to complete for 3k, then he request to extend beyond 40. However, by extending, he still need to take ippt."
This kinda is chao keng early years then now got goodie then want to extend.
"So, nobody can force a person if he does not want to extend, right?"
kum gongz lor. 3k waste so much time....and effort.
Exp.the army . where its a total.waste of time. And has no real.value in the real.world.
"Why TS u so concern? U how old now?  Btw, is always good to try to clear and complete the entire cycles as early as possible. After that, MR liao. Relax."
that person himself request to extend...not kena force 1.  Unless parliament implement new bill to extend reservist age to counter low birth rates.
Unless u officer lor
"wooo, another 10 more years of living overseas and i won't need to get called back and all that sh!t again.  :X"
"Unless u r officer, else once reached 40, complete or no complete your cycles, out u go. No one will call you back for ICT anymore after that. No one will go extend your service either."
i heard officer is 45
"eh . . you got serve reservist one or not? u ish xdd or some ft? simi unfair for other reservist who complete usually those didnt complete 10 cycles are actually the most suffering one because unit no call back, ippt till 40 year is a nightmare man. everyone just wanna clear the 10 cycles, those holan bo tio call up is really feel sad for them"
"yeah. 3k bigger than bull cart wheels. just scrap the fugging 2 years NS and keep the puny 3k and ranjiao allowances la. pcb.  anyways, im one of those that they havent called back but they should know what to expect when im back..."
No need. Unless chiu are occifer.
"officer is until 50 i thought. they revised to 45 now?  Applicability The annual IPPT is applicable to all PES A, B/B1, B2/C1 NSmen and DXO with NS liability, till age 45 and 40 years old for Officers and WOSPEC respectively. The NSman's IPPT annual requirement commences on his birthday immediately after his NSF Operational Ready Date (ORD) and ends when he is posted to MINDEF Reserves (MR), or medically downgraded to PES C2 and below.  ok 45....... but i think for KAH some may extend to 50?"
"Hello. You can call NSSC to check but let me share:  1. If you are not an officer, your unit will send you a letter to say you no longer need to serve. But if u don't finish your 7 high key and 10 year cycle, u won't get watch and 10 year long service medal  2. If you reach 40 years old and you are short of 1 high key, then they can ask u whether you want to volunteer your service to extend as a volunteer. U can choose to do so or reject.  Nowadays NSSC and unit are getting more service orientated. If you are unsure, feel free to send them an email"
Ha-ha u Siam all the way rite?
why not? reservist so relac.  paid vacation.  pay u salary to sleep in camp.
"Complete fast.the older u are,more xiong."
"i finished mine 2 years back. got the watch , medals etc. truth be told, i miss gng back for reservist where i can tcss with my buddies.. and to be away from work too."
"Best, after MR? No ippt yearly。"
+1 for this.
"How I hope they call me up for another ICT cycle, best is to go aussie or brunei again"
"Agree. Imagine u 37, 38, 39... still need to go back ICT.  Not only physically u may find challenging, by then, u probably have tons of work commitments and family commitments.  Better clear them up asap."
You didn't receive this meh?
"So sianz, no more IPPT, Range, SOC, route march, FIBUA, FOFO, BCTC, ICT & Open mob is really not getting use to it"
"See NSF, regular & reservist wearing the new lumber 4 is jin satki, moi is so envious"
Calll saf to confrim. Tell them ur name n ic number.
"Really missed the day of NSF, wake up early do 5 BX, arbo jog and exercise with wooden log.  Or else go swimming in lumber 4 at selarang pools in lap, gone are the day of digging self script and trenches or sit assault boat & do captize drill at sea follow by formation, once finish next carry the boat back and washes it ourself before returning it back to the boat man"
u all seen any recuit back for reservice one??? I dun wan go back
commissioned officers loh
"Sometimes didn't complete is unit never call them up, not their fault leh. They still have to do IPPT/RT till 40 even if unit didn't call them up leh. They suffer even more than those who managed to complete by 30+"
"  I'm 35 this year. Till today, only did 4 high key. This oct doing 5th one. Dunno will they start increasing the frequency of calling me back soon?"
"Sian ... confirm do until 40 yrs old liao  Just completed 2 low keys  CO ji dao say 1st 3 low, 7 high and preare for E-tag ...  I'm didn't call back till 2013 and ORD 2005.  gg liao XD"
" depends, my platoon mate ippt is for him to earn extra few hundred since he was gold all the way and work outside was very siong and ict was almost sleeping all the way."
is it good to serve reservist later. After 27 yr old then start first ICT.
Are you the kind who can pass IPPT?
I received 2 Long service medals. ORDed in 2000 MRed in 2015
I spy wif moi eye some birdy who necro-ed a 2 year old thread
You talk about unfair? Compared to all the foreigners who did nothing while enjoying the peace and prosperity and job security and jobs at our expenses?
Anyone reach 40 and never received letter from mindef?
 
"50 years old... if they appt holders meant early go and late go back... briefings, meeting and other stuffs..."
Basket saf sent me letter to collect good service medal. How many medals they want to give me!
" If they award you another Singapore Armed Forces National Service Medal (10 years), they are wasting their resources & your time.  If they award you Singapore Armed Forces National Service Medal with 15 year clasp, you benefits from it & should be happy cause by right you should not earn it since you have MRed. "
Cork ups do happen. Some of my ICT mates have gotten the 5 year medal twice 🙄
Like that they can skip the 10 year medal since 5+5=10.
 
Nice try. They got one 5 year during 5th ICT & a second 5 year during 6th ICT.
"WOSE are liable for NS call ups (including IPPT) until the statutory age of 40, this occurs when the NSmen did not managed to clock 7 HK in 10 ORNS years before turning 40. They are not counted as MINDEF Reserves but rather, Ex-NS - means they will lose out on the 3rd HOME Awards.  Officers are liable for NS call ups (including IPPT) until the statutory age of 50. Same as above, did not managed to clock 7 HK in 10 ORNS years before turning 50. For officers however, their IPPT statutory age cease at 45, meaning after they turn 45 and have yet to be phased into MR, they are still eligible for IPPT but NOT required to."
do they base the age on start of financial year or date of birth for the individual
"Should be DOB but if you got a callup on a date after your 40th birthday, then better call to clarify."
It's base on your DOB
"thank you, cause i used to be regular, so still serving my reservists for now."
Normally fully discharged at age of 40 unless u are in officer ranking
"Anyone whom's ORD 2012/13, had never done any ICT.  I have not been activate for ICT since 2013 until now. and my peer all doing ICT. Even later than me who ord also done the 1st ICT"
I think must see unit too. Those pretty active and have to go through ATEC will get called up quite often. What's your NS vocation?
"Depends on unit and vocation. I was on holding list for 5 years after I ORD, no IPPT no mob manning no briefing no ICT. I believe it's because my active unit does not have a vacancy for me. But I SAF100 on 6th year, then after that every year also on ICT liao. Just received my MR cert last year, but not yet 40yo. Just curious. What are the chances of me kena call up for ICT? The FBO and uniforms are taking up space lor, which I am tempted to just bring to emart and drop there. Sent from Xiaomi REDMI NOTE 4 using GAGT"
"after pass 40 , they will not call u for anything whether u finished 10 cycles or not... by statutory legislation u are discharged."
keep until 40... then after that can return

If you served in those active battalions during your NSF days most likely you will start your reservist very soon (a year or two after ORD). Not so sure about those serving in active brigades.  Last time during my NSF days I was an active personnel serving in an reservist brigade and I was put into holding list for more than 8 years after I ORDed and at most I would have done 9 ICTs (if they called up every year) by the time I reaches 40.

" It is possible for your unit to arrange ICTs to allow you to clock the required 10 cycles before you turn 40 (or 50 for officers).   But this will have to be carefully arranged. SAF work year is April to end March, so whatever briefings, ICTs, etc, will have to fall within the appropriate months.   It is a waste that some NSmen have been attending 9 cycles and then lose out just because they turn 40/50 before their last cycle is clocked.   Sometimes it is the NSmen's defering their ICT, but sometimes it is because their unit couldn't schedule the ICT every year.   Personally - my unit is able to arrange dedicated ICTs for those NSmen that are just missing out on their last 10th cycle and about to reach the 40/50 age limit, as the next battalion ICT isn't scheduled for the next SAF working year."
If my birthday falls after April it is still possible that I can clock 10 cycles but too bad my birthday falls on February and my remaining ICTs will be all high keys.
" Yes, if your birthday falls before April, then you won't be able to add any more.   How many more HK ICTs you have to complete to reach the 10 cycles?"
Already served 3 LK and 2 HK ICTs and left with 5 HK ICTs.
 5 HKs left... and you are already close to 40?
 
matey1982 wrote: U reaching 40 by when? I am turning 36 soon.  If they called up every year at most I can complete 4 more HKs before I ROD.
"Yes, it looks like you will miss your last 10th cycle. If your unit isn't scheduling ICTs every year... you may even miss out on the 9th cycle. Try contacting your unit, ask them what are your options. But based on your Feb birth month... hard to squeeze in any more."
"I have a feeling that they might not call up every year, especially after the 7th ICT ATEC2."
It only count as 1 ORNS activity in the same work year 
"Ts, i never completed 10 yr cycle. only 2 LK i went.  Its been 15 years I ORD in Full time NS. Cos i was on exit permit all the while. AFter 40 they dont call u already. send u ROD certificate and u can say goodbye to them"
keep the uniform. there is always a chance they call u up again. as long u are <40. Return uniform is only for PES F or those reached 40.
No need unless you are an officer or you self volunteered to extend your service.
Anyone knows if it's age 40 or after age 40? (age 41).
"""not more than 40 years of age"""
"mai volunteer lah  finish 10-year cycle, siew gang"
What kind of activities count as ORNS? I haven’t done a single ICT and it says I completed 4 ORNS year.
"Activity like ICT, mobilisation or call up for briefing"
Didn’t go for any of that lol. But somehow my ORNS year is increasing.
You go where check your ORNS cycle?

When u receive saf100. There’s some admin documents with everyone’s information. And ORNS is stated there.
Anyone here lost a ict cycle due to the pandemic? Wondering if mindef will count the lost year as one year orns cycle cleared
why so? there are others who skip 1 year also.
"i still have some buffer, but if lose one or two more years, i might not be able to clear 10 cycles before reaching 40 years.  there would be some who are turning 40 this year and can't do orns #10 due to pandemic,"
Then your NS obligation will just create. They wouldn’t extend you.
"I know that...but will lose the cpf bonus from completing orns, that is the concern"
That one I think is need to go MP liao.  Because I think that’s the least of their concern now
between doing the ORN cycle to clock the quota for the work year vs steering clear of pandemic i would choose the latter
really meh. like that ippt also counted? i only went for ippt last 3 years.
think now more activities are counted towards being recognised as ORNS activity.  eg IPPT counted as 1/2 day attendance
NSdotSG under the eServices Manage Callup and Manning can log in and check.
U go rt sibo
oic that is much better than last time liao
"Hmm i think i also need wait till 40 years old because of how my unit operates, like i need pass shooting (cause i bobo) before deployment.  Last year i failed then no deployment they no count my cycle fml  I tried asking ns helpdesk they say i should wait till end of 2020 fy..  Fml 10 more years to reach 40"
liddat is bo hua one leh
"no need, MR"
"Ya lo, how ah ? The only good is escape from work for that maintenance period up till 40 years old. Bad is need take ippt/rt until 40 sian. Then platoonmate eventually also rod. Then remaining years become floater .."
u alrdy done hw many cycles?
"Counted as 4, Actual should be 5"
so is 4 or 5 cycles for u and u left hw many yrs to hit magic 40
10 wholesome years lol
ok lah agar agar if u dont defer and what knots can MR by 35 or 36 bah?
"Wah, tough eh, if need to, but I guess going back is not too bad sometimes ah..."
To be fair going back for reservists got its pros and cons...
i know where you r coming from for your POV
No time for reservist

"Didn't know there is 3k to collect. But if a Singaporean male did not complete all cycles by 40, he does not deserve anything. Otherwise, it would be unfair to other Singaporean males who did complete."
"Max: 40 for Nsf-nsmen (regardless u completed how many cycle)  there are rare cases, this happens in my unit, that person need two more cycle to complete for 3k, then he request to extend beyond 40. However, by extending, he still need to take ippt."
This kinda is chao keng early years then now got goodie then want to extend.
"So, nobody can force a person if he does not want to extend, right?"
kum gongz lor. 3k waste so much time....and effort.
Exp.the army . where its a total.waste of time. And has no real.value in the real.world.
"Why TS u so concern? U how old now?  Btw, is always good to try to clear and complete the entire cycles as early as possible. After that, MR liao. Relax."
that person himself request to extend...not kena force 1.  Unless parliament implement new bill to extend reservist age to counter low birth rates.
Unless u officer lor
"wooo, another 10 more years of living overseas and i won't need to get called back and all that sh!t again.  :X"
"Unless u r officer, else once reached 40, complete or no complete your cycles, out u go. No one will call you back for ICT anymore after that. No one will go extend your service either."
i heard officer is 45
"eh . . you got serve reservist one or not? u ish xdd or some ft? simi unfair for other reservist who complete usually those didnt complete 10 cycles are actually the most suffering one because unit no call back, ippt till 40 year is a nightmare man. everyone just wanna clear the 10 cycles, those holan bo tio call up is really feel sad for them"
"yeah. 3k bigger than bull cart wheels. just scrap the fugging 2 years NS and keep the puny 3k and ranjiao allowances la. pcb.  anyways, im one of those that they havent called back but they should know what to expect when im back..."
No need. Unless chiu are occifer.
"officer is until 50 i thought. they revised to 45 now?  Applicability The annual IPPT is applicable to all PES A, B/B1, B2/C1 NSmen and DXO with NS liability, till age 45 and 40 years old for Officers and WOSPEC respectively. The NSman's IPPT annual requirement commences on his birthday immediately after his NSF Operational Ready Date (ORD) and ends when he is posted to MINDEF Reserves (MR), or medically downgraded to PES C2 and below.  ok 45....... but i think for KAH some may extend to 50?"
"Hello. You can call NSSC to check but let me share:  1. If you are not an officer, your unit will send you a letter to say you no longer need to serve. But if u don't finish your 7 high key and 10 year cycle, u won't get watch and 10 year long service medal  2. If you reach 40 years old and you are short of 1 high key, then they can ask u whether you want to volunteer your service to extend as a volunteer. U can choose to do so or reject.  Nowadays NSSC and unit are getting more service orientated. If you are unsure, feel free to send them an email"
Ha-ha u Siam all the way rite?
why not? reservist so relac.  paid vacation.  pay u salary to sleep in camp.
"Complete fast.the older u are,more xiong."
"i finished mine 2 years back. got the watch , medals etc. truth be told, i miss gng back for reservist where i can tcss with my buddies.. and to be away from work too."
"Best, after MR? No ippt yearly。"
+1 for this.
"How I hope they call me up for another ICT cycle, best is to go aussie or brunei again"
"Agree. Imagine u 37, 38, 39... still need to go back ICT.  Not only physically u may find challenging, by then, u probably have tons of work commitments and family commitments.  Better clear them up asap."
You didn't receive this meh?
"So sianz, no more IPPT, Range, SOC, route march, FIBUA, FOFO, BCTC, ICT & Open mob is really not getting use to it"
"See NSF, regular & reservist wearing the new lumber 4 is jin satki, moi is so envious"
Calll saf to confrim. Tell them ur name n ic number.
"Really missed the day of NSF, wake up early do 5 BX, arbo jog and exercise with wooden log.  Or else go swimming in lumber 4 at selarang pools in lap, gone are the day of digging self script and trenches or sit assault boat & do captize drill at sea follow by formation, once finish next carry the boat back and washes it ourself before returning it back to the boat man"
u all seen any recuit back for reservice one??? I dun wan go back
commissioned officers loh
"Sometimes didn't complete is unit never call them up, not their fault leh. They still have to do IPPT/RT till 40 even if unit didn't call them up leh. They suffer even more than those who managed to complete by 30+"
"  I'm 35 this year. Till today, only did 4 high key. This oct doing 5th one. Dunno will they start increasing the frequency of calling me back soon?"
"Sian ... confirm do until 40 yrs old liao  Just completed 2 low keys  CO ji dao say 1st 3 low, 7 high and preare for E-tag ...  I'm didn't call back till 2013 and ORD 2005.  gg liao XD"
" depends, my platoon mate ippt is for him to earn extra few hundred since he was gold all the way and work outside was very siong and ict was almost sleeping all the way."
is it good to serve reservist later. After 27 yr old then start first ICT.
Are you the kind who can pass IPPT?
I received 2 Long service medals. ORDed in 2000 MRed in 2015
I spy wif moi eye some birdy who necro-ed a 2 year old thread
You talk about unfair? Compared to all the foreigners who did nothing while enjoying the peace and prosperity and job security and jobs at our expenses?
Anyone reach 40 and never received letter from mindef?
 
"50 years old... if they appt holders meant early go and late go back... briefings, meeting and other stuffs..."
Basket saf sent me letter to collect good service medal. How many medals they want to give me!
" If they award you another Singapore Armed Forces National Service Medal (10 years), they are wasting their resources & your time.  If they award you Singapore Armed Forces National Service Medal with 15 year clasp, you benefits from it & should be happy cause by right you should not earn it since you have MRed. "
Cork ups do happen. Some of my ICT mates have gotten the 5 year medal twice 🙄
Like that they can skip the 10 year medal since 5+5=10.
 
Nice try. They got one 5 year during 5th ICT & a second 5 year during 6th ICT.
"WOSE are liable for NS call ups (including IPPT) until the statutory age of 40, this occurs when the NSmen did not managed to clock 7 HK in 10 ORNS years before turning 40. They are not counted as MINDEF Reserves but rather, Ex-NS - means they will lose out on the 3rd HOME Awards.  Officers are liable for NS call ups (including IPPT) until the statutory age of 50. Same as above, did not managed to clock 7 HK in 10 ORNS years before turning 50. For officers however, their IPPT statutory age cease at 45, meaning after they turn 45 and have yet to be phased into MR, they are still eligible for IPPT but NOT required to."
do they base the age on start of financial year or date of birth for the individual
"Should be DOB but if you got a callup on a date after your 40th birthday, then better call to clarify."
It's base on your DOB
"thank you, cause i used to be regular, so still serving my reservists for now."
Normally fully discharged at age of 40 unless u are in officer ranking
"Anyone whom's ORD 2012/13, had never done any ICT.  I have not been activate for ICT since 2013 until now. and my peer all doing ICT. Even later than me who ord also done the 1st ICT"
I think must see unit too. Those pretty active and have to go through ATEC will get called up quite often. What's your NS vocation?
"Depends on unit and vocation. I was on holding list for 5 years after I ORD, no IPPT no mob manning no briefing no ICT. I believe it's because my active unit does not have a vacancy for me. But I SAF100 on 6th year, then after that every year also on ICT liao. Just received my MR cert last year, but not yet 40yo. Just curious. What are the chances of me kena call up for ICT? The FBO and uniforms are taking up space lor, which I am tempted to just bring to emart and drop there. Sent from Xiaomi REDMI NOTE 4 using GAGT"
"after pass 40 , they will not call u for anything whether u finished 10 cycles or not... by statutory legislation u are discharged."
keep until 40... then after that can return

If you served in those active battalions during your NSF days most likely you will start your reservist very soon (a year or two after ORD). Not so sure about those serving in active brigades.  Last time during my NSF days I was an active personnel serving in an reservist brigade and I was put into holding list for more than 8 years after I ORDed and at most I would have done 9 ICTs (if they called up every year) by the time I reaches 40.

" It is possible for your unit to arrange ICTs to allow you to clock the required 10 cycles before you turn 40 (or 50 for officers).   But this will have to be carefully arranged. SAF work year is April to end March, so whatever briefings, ICTs, etc, will have to fall within the appropriate months.   It is a waste that some NSmen have been attending 9 cycles and then lose out just because they turn 40/50 before their last cycle is clocked.   Sometimes it is the NSmen's defering their ICT, but sometimes it is because their unit couldn't schedule the ICT every year.   Personally - my unit is able to arrange dedicated ICTs for those NSmen that are just missing out on their last 10th cycle and about to reach the 40/50 age limit, as the next battalion ICT isn't scheduled for the next SAF working year."
If my birthday falls after April it is still possible that I can clock 10 cycles but too bad my birthday falls on February and my remaining ICTs will be all high keys.
" Yes, if your birthday falls before April, then you won't be able to add any more.   How many more HK ICTs you have to complete to reach the 10 cycles?"
Already served 3 LK and 2 HK ICTs and left with 5 HK ICTs.
 5 HKs left... and you are already close to 40?
 
matey1982 wrote: U reaching 40 by when? I am turning 36 soon.  If they called up every year at most I can complete 4 more HKs before I ROD.
"Yes, it looks like you will miss your last 10th cycle. If your unit isn't scheduling ICTs every year... you may even miss out on the 9th cycle. Try contacting your unit, ask them what are your options. But based on your Feb birth month... hard to squeeze in any more."
"I have a feeling that they might not call up every year, especially after the 7th ICT ATEC2."
It only count as 1 ORNS activity in the same work year 
"Ts, i never completed 10 yr cycle. only 2 LK i went.  Its been 15 years I ORD in Full time NS. Cos i was on exit permit all the while. AFter 40 they dont call u already. send u ROD certificate and u can say goodbye to them"
keep the uniform. there is always a chance they call u up again. as long u are <40. Return uniform is only for PES F or those reached 40.
No need unless you are an officer or you self volunteered to extend your service.
Anyone knows if it's age 40 or after age 40? (age 41).
"""not more than 40 years of age"""
"mai volunteer lah  finish 10-year cycle, siew gang"
What kind of activities count as ORNS? I haven’t done a single ICT and it says I completed 4 ORNS year.
"Activity like ICT, mobilisation or call up for briefing"
Didn’t go for any of that lol. But somehow my ORNS year is increasing.
You go where check your ORNS cycle?

When u receive saf100. There’s some admin documents with everyone’s information. And ORNS is stated there.
Anyone here lost a ict cycle due to the pandemic? Wondering if mindef will count the lost year as one year orns cycle cleared
why so? there are others who skip 1 year also.
"i still have some buffer, but if lose one or two more years, i might not be able to clear 10 cycles before reaching 40 years.  there would be some who are turning 40 this year and can't do orns #10 due to pandemic,"
Then your NS obligation will just create. They wouldn’t extend you.
"I know that...but will lose the cpf bonus from completing orns, that is the concern"
That one I think is need to go MP liao.  Because I think that’s the least of their concern now
between doing the ORN cycle to clock the quota for the work year vs steering clear of pandemic i would choose the latter
really meh. like that ippt also counted? i only went for ippt last 3 years.
think now more activities are counted towards being recognised as ORNS activity.  eg IPPT counted as 1/2 day attendance
NSdotSG under the eServices Manage Callup and Manning can log in and check.
U go rt sibo
oic that is much better than last time liao
"Hmm i think i also need wait till 40 years old because of how my unit operates, like i need pass shooting (cause i bobo) before deployment.  Last year i failed then no deployment they no count my cycle fml  I tried asking ns helpdesk they say i should wait till end of 2020 fy..  Fml 10 more years to reach 40"
liddat is bo hua one leh
"no need, MR"
"Ya lo, how ah ? The only good is escape from work for that maintenance period up till 40 years old. Bad is need take ippt/rt until 40 sian. Then platoonmate eventually also rod. Then remaining years become floater .."
u alrdy done hw many cycles?
"Counted as 4, Actual should be 5"
so is 4 or 5 cycles for u and u left hw many yrs to hit magic 40
10 wholesome years lol
ok lah agar agar if u dont defer and what knots can MR by 35 or 36 bah?
"Wah, tough eh, if need to, but I guess going back is not too bad sometimes ah..."
To be fair going back for reservists got its pros and cons...
i know where you r coming from for your POV
No time for reservist
u white horse ah?
"Hi guys, Just a question. I'm having an IPPT on thurs 21/12 (last booking before my window closes) However, today I'm have fever and flu which i do not think will recover in time for thurs.  Am I suppose to tell the PTI to just fail me straight or do I need to produce MC?"
enter camp either in PT attire or CV.
yes correct
"you have to do all station, including 2.4 run. You can walk all the way. If dont complete, no attendance is given."
"finish all 3 stations otherwise your attendance will be forefited.  fail your ippt and ur attendance will still be considered.  unless under medical grounds (e.g cramps, faint etc)"
"If you did not attempt IPPT, they can charge you. PTI will not fail u without any attempting the stations. It is a rule. So my suggestion is, u got MC, and u want to fail, just go, do 1 sit up, 1 pushup, walk the 2.4. Get the attendance."
"produce MC because u are not supposed to take IPPT if u have MC over the past 3 days. your unit will still charge u for failing to satisfy your window, but warning will may be issued instead."
definition of cv = long pants/jeans?
"yes, n no slippers or sandals.  what kind of attire were u allowed to book-in into camps during your active times?"
Pass 51 points got incentive?  Or need Pass plus 61 points?  NSman here
"Below 61 no money 61 and above - $200 (pass) 75 and above - $300 (silver) 85 annd above - $500 (gold) 90 and above(for commando ,guards, diver) - $500 (gold)"

"anyhow knows what happens if u didnt go for a single session of RT ah? first time offense, next window get charge?"
"If I don't start my ICT cycle before my 30th birthday, does it mean I confirm will do IPPT until 40 years old?"
"u will be considered as a ippt defaulter and will be charged accordingly (e.g warning, fine etc)."
most likely yes as high chances u will not be able to meet 7HK3LK
"Yo guys, how’s the RT nowadays ah? Will it be Super shiong? Need to mentally and physically prep myself"
Nowadays RT very short. 1 hour exercise only. Last time is at least 1.5h of exercise.
definitely not shiong like bmt or any saf training.
Hi guys  I'm attending my last high key on this feb 2018 and will rod  Will i still need to attend the remaining rt for this year and the my birthday falls on May  Thanks alot
"Hey guys, i have recently attended my first IPT-IPPT session and intended to go for the IPT in the park programme. I tried to ask the cisco instructors about the program but they said they dont know and that it is handled by other company. The NS portal also seem to be under maintenance.  Just want to check if anyone has experience attending such programme? For example, where to meet at marina bay? do they also issue colored bands for training? and how they generate the slip for attendance? Many thanks!"
I last time took IPT-In-The-Park regularly at Jurong Park (Now MINDEF have removed this location due to low attendance) and yes it is conducted by another fitness company. Usually when you arrived at their meeting point they will take your temperature and ask you to sign their attendence list as inpro. There is no colour band as they have only one type of training programme for that session like for example: circuit training + yoga or kickboxing + endurance running etc. And after the training before you leave you are required to sign the attendance list again as outpro and one or two working days later they will update your attendance on ns.sg
"I find it easier to earn money at older age, maybe due to reduced requirements  Sent from Sony Z4 using GAGT"
"Hi, I would like to ask if I could retake my IPPT again before my birthday if I were to fail."
"Wow still have yoga or kickboxing, thats quite interesting. thanks alot for sharing the experience"
will i have still have to complete 20 rt next cycle? thanks
definitely yes.
"u can take an unlimited attempts of IPPT. only if u are to qualify for the higher award (pass w incentives to silver or gold), u will be paid additional for the difference."
"by right MR cycle will only officially end on every April of the year due to SAF workyear. Therefore, u are actually required to attend the remaining RTs. But on the other hand, SAF is quite lenient towards such cases of not completing the cycle. I am curious, since u had attended so many NS cycles, why wasn't such an info made know to u by your peers or commanders?"
"Hi, suppose if i'm required to take rt next window, am I required to do ippt in the next window as well?"
there will be RT-IPPT in the stipulated RT sessions. take note on that.  you cannot book a separate non-ICT-IPPT if u are under RT program. but u can take ICT-IPPT during your ICT and can be cleared of your window provided u pass.
"Hi, thanks for your reply. So what happens if I fail the RT-IPPT but I clear all 20 session of RT, am I required to do RT for the next window?"
"No. similar to IPT, as long u have attended the require number of sessions, u will be cleared of that window. Your next window will be new, where u can choose to do IPT (10 sessions) or clear your window with just 1 ""PASS"" IPPT."
"Guys, dont mind me asking. can I drive in to Khatib camp to take IPPT? if yes, do you know where is the car park? and how's the process going to be, go in with car then report to guard house to change pass then go in?  anyone has drive in before and would like to ask for their experience .  Thank you"
Any idea what happens if I failed to turn up for an IPPT booking? Hearsay miss 3 times the system will block you from booking then how to unblock?
"Does RT/IPT still have that brown tag ""specialised training"" which is MMA/spin/Aerobic class? Damn fun leh."
"drive into the checkpoint just after the guardroom and pass ur IC to them for them to check on the nominal roll if ur name is there. carpark is at the open area just beside the FCC. u can ask the checkpoint IC if in doubt. lastly, in-pro at the FCC counter at ur session timing."
u have 8 IPT sessions to find this info out. Or more than 8 session if u are under RT.
"If i MR in june 2018, and my window closes in nov 2018, do i still need to complete RT?"
"If I have to book and find out myself, whats the point of asking? Besides, my window isn't opened yet. Don't have anything useful to post, keep it to yourself."
"Guys I have a question here.  I kena summary trial for not attending ippt/ipt/rt, however I'm perm excuse rmj, which is impossible for me to do any ippt due to medical issue. Is anyone in a similar situation as me? And how do you deal with it?"
"The point is if you are not exempt or excused ippt/ipt/rt, you still needs to attend those activities & up to Trainer/Tester to determine what they want to do to you on the spot (may just mark attendance & go home even if it is a waste of time). Now your case is consider AWOL & I will recommend you to think of a sound judgement statement with supporting documents to answer for summary trial to lower the offence. I never been in your situation before, so can't advice you much on this."
"Unless you reach the age of 40, you can't MR in June. If your last ict is in June, then you will MR on 1st April the following year.  As for whether you need to complete your RT, it's up to you if you want to take a chance. If the charge letter comes after 1st April, then you will be free. If not, you may have to go face a charge before you can MR."
the point is there is no rush in getting an answer
Can retake as many times as you want but only the first 3 ippt will be paid.
"huh why must wait till april following year when my MR ceremony this year? i thought go MR ceremony, get cert can liao?? still must wait till following for what sia?"
Because SAF work year starts on 1st Apr and ends on 31st March.
"Have a qn here. I booked an IPPT session today but not feeling well. NS Portal is down for maintenance also so I can't book another session yet. Will I get penalised for booking but not showing up? Or no prob, just book another session before my window closes?  Also, I ORD late-Nov 2016, so currently am I 0th or 1st year?"
November to your first birthday is 0.
"Any kind soul pls help to answer this:  I booked an IPT-IPPT next week, but i can only book one session. Cos i am thinking about booking the whole 10 session one short. The system does not allow me to do so. I very long never take IPT, is it the system changed?"
Hi there  Any brothers knw which area to report for ipt at bishan amk park? First time doing ippt at the park  Thanks
"Sorry bro u still got to do ippt. I was like u also as i was temp excuse for rmj due to back problem. Called ns hotline and refer my case to some cso. They email me back stating im still liable for ippt as i wasnt excuse from ippt/ipt/rt. They told me see m.o n “discuss” my status. I was like wtf?! Gv me rmj n expect me to do 2.4km bt sadly i LL must do ippt or not kena charged. I also dont wanna risk it cos i still can perform ipt which is way better than rt My advice to u is go see ur specialist for a letter n when go for trial explain ur condition to the DO. Talk nicely n maybe he might reprimand u. Bt if u really got legit medical problem, book a medical appointment and see MO for another medical review"

"Hi, i am going to get 20RT cause i fail my previous IPPT.. first time RT here.. Where is the nearest RT to hougang? and what time usually does it start/end? what do i have to bring/do there?  sorry for the noob question"
"thanks, Bro!"
forgotten to add on.. make sure u do have the sms notification in your phone in case your name is not in the nominal roll
"nearest FCC for RT will be Khartib (list of RT venues can be found in your RT booking page). at the booking page will show u the session timings be in your PT attire when reporting to FCC, and no slippers/sandals to be worn into the camp. activity wise will be normal physical training and u can choose from the various kinds of training - running (red tag), games (orange tag), cardio/statics (blue) etc etc... or if you BMI considers u as being overweight, your tag will be standard green."
"thank you, i just call NS hotline and check, they say got 7:30 time slot. i wonder i end work at 6:30 from tanjong pagar can reach there in time with public transport not.."
in this case i suggest u go Maju Camp instead
"Hi there, hoping for some advice on the following. If my last ICT was in June 2017 and my MR is in Apr 2018, do I need to clear my IPPT if my window closes in June 2018? If so, and I fail, am I subjected to RT?"
"No. As the official cut-off for any IPPT window is every Apr. For your case, your MR is already at Apr and therefore, u are no longer subjected to any Mindef activities unless u have been recalled from the MR list."
Hi anybody?
"is opposite Macdonals, across the ""river"".. where u can see some open shelter.  if u are standing at mac, it is somewhere at your 10 o'clock direction."
"Hi guys. If I attend 10 sessions of ipt inclusive going for 1st session and last session of ippt, but did not fulfil the ppt standard. Am I still considered to have clear my ippt obligations?"
yes. regardless pass or fail.
"hi guys, can check nowadays still have games for RT? went maju 3 times but always only blue and red."
any idea which FCC have?
"Looks like it has been raining on and off since the start of the new year till now, hence any attempts for ippt shall be postponed till further notice.  When do you guys think will be a good time to attempt ippt?"
"Hi, the information that you provided previously was incorrect. Please refer to the following: https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...idelines-rt/rt Quote: In the event that D is more than 20, it will be capped at 20. You will not have to take RT but must attempt at least 1 IPPT (i.e. Non-ICT IPPT or ICT IPPT) in your IPPT Window. IPPT is also conducted on the 8th, 14th and 20th RT sessions (also known as RT IPPT). But if there are less than 8 RT sessions, RT IPPT will be held on the last session. Hence, the correct answer is :In window 16/17, I only have to attend 7 RT sessions, and the 7th session will be my RT-IPPT. I will not be a defaulter in the following window."
"Hi, please see my previous post to correct your misunderstanding on this matter."
"your posts was from a long time ago btw.  whether was it a misunderstanding or not, thanks for you in pointing it out if you have understood the system.  still, i think u do not understand the post that we had replied to your query."
"Calander wrote: y not u try and test the system? and service pay is only given for a max. of 3 IPPT sessions. whereas all IPTs and RTs are payable. let us know after u done with 20 IPPTs, and were u being charged. Hi, yes you can do this. The rule is 20-D, and 20-20 = 0, so you do not need to do any RT. You will not be charged. However, you must still attempt 1 IPPT in the next window. PS: Sorry for the late reply. Took many months to attempt all those IPPTs sessions."
"Hi, sorry for the (very) late reply. My window only just passed, and I was only able to confirm this recently. My query was in relation to the 20-D rule. Specifically, what happens if you take IPPT a lot of times, and D is like 15, 18, or even 20. Perhaps quoting your entire post was confusing. Take note of the underlined part: Take note... Conditions to enter RT - 1. Failed or defaulted your Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) in your previous window, or 2. Did not complete your IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) in your previous window U will still need to do RT even if u have had 20 IPPTs due to clause (1) mentioned above. The correct answer is: You will not need to do RT if you have attempted IPPT 20 times, but you still need to attempt IPPT once in your next window."
"thanks for highlighting this point for clarity sake. anyway in this case, only the first 3 IPPT will be entitled to 1/2 service pay. whereas all 10x IPT or up to 20x RT sessions has this service pay. therefore, whether to do 20x IPPT to substitute for 20x RTs is another simple question to think about. bottomline is, nobody will ever do 20x IPPTs"
"Nobody except me maybe? That's why when I asked, no one could answer as it is a rarely-encountered scenario. Yes, only the first 3 IPPT are paid. But the amount to me is really insignificant, that's why this wasn't a factor at all. (It may be to other people though) Due to real life commitments, I was really free last year, but knew I would be really busy this year. That's why I wanted to do more sessions last year to reduce my obligation for this year. Furthermore, I find IPPT much more ""chill"" than RT. You don't have to follow the pace of the instructors. In extreme case, you can even do what Supporter said: 1 sit up 1 push up walk 30 min 2.4km. Whereas RT is more ""siong"". (I guess this is subjective though? Some people chill their way through RT also) All in all, I'm happy things worked out, and just like to share this info with other people who may encounter same scenario as me."
"fair enough. but still, considering in just having to do 10x IPTs rather than 20x IPPT or RTs... 20x IPPTs still worthy in your opinion?"
"I did my IPPT last week (for prev window) and failed. Now current window till next year is 19 RT sessions.  On the website, it states 1st, 8th and 20th session are RT-IPPT. Now that one session is taken off (20-1=19), does that mean my 1st and 8th RT are IPPT sessions and that's it? Or the 20th session IPPT shifted onto an earlier session?"
"Total number of sessions would still be 20 over 2 years whether you do IPT, IPPT, or RT. (if you fail all the way) The difference, as you pointed out, is the entitlement to service pay, and the timing of these session. I merely chose to do more sessions last year to lessen the burden this year. I do agree most people would prefer to spread out 10 sessions each year (plus get paid too!)"
Ippt no more rank pay? I only receive my ippt award
Guys. I need help. I just called maju fcc they tell me IPPT only got 5pm slot and 7pm slot is for RT kind. Is it true?
https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/iminde..._as_nsmen.html  https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/iminde...s/afc/fcc.html  2 links for u to refer
all counts minus one
So means 1st ses IPPT - RT till 8th ses IPPT then the rest till ses 19 is RT?
"this is what the '20-D' means. if unsure on the meaning of 'D', i strongly suggest u to do a simple goggle search on IPPT, IPT, RT requirements."
Hi guys pls help me.  My bday 29th jan. Den 30th jan i go take my ippt. I book the first session ipt slot cos there put 1st ipt is ippt. I got silver but so far until now i no receive sms say i clear my 18/19 window liao. May i know usually how long ah. The ns sg also no update my attendance
it takes about 3 working days for processing. u will receive an SMS saying that u have fulfilled your IPPT requirements.
"Hey guys, if i pass my IPT-IPPT which is the first session, does it also means i've clear the window too?"
"Hi guys, may I know if we will receive rank pay for weekend IPT/RT?"
Yes to both questions.
"Hi guys,  newbie here  Current window closes at 16 Feb 18, should i go IPT now as i'm not sure if i'm able to pass IPPT.."
"Ipt first lesson is an ippt. Just go book that and pass it. If fail, just go for another 19 lessons."
"If fail, I need clear this 19 RTs.  So next window still need ippt?"
"do not mistake IPT program with RT. if under RT, u can only take RT-IPPT at 8th, 14th, 20th session. only the for IPT, 1st and 10th session is IPT-IPPT."
"Just asking if I already cleared my RT for 2017 year. My next cycle for ippt opens at 17march. When during ICT this week , if there is ippt, can I don’t take it ? Because I want to be in IPT program."
If you don't want to pass then purposely fail la or fall out. But I think you have to take the IPPT if you're fit to do it because one of the KPI for ICT is the IPPT participation rate.
"But if I fail, then will I need to go for RT?"
For safra what the treadmill speed ah
"u do not need to take RT if fail ICT-IPPT. And u are still free to take IPT.  Nevertheless, even if u pass your ICT-IPPT with any awards, u can still go for IPT. It will be good to have the target for a higher award if applicable. The good thing is that you do not have to satisfy 10 IPT sessions as u had already fulfilled your requirement."
My new ippt window has opened and requires to book and attend  I'm having ICT coming March  And if I participate the ICT ippt means I have cleared my window for the working year?
"Hi guys, anyone knows if the minimum 1 point requirement in each station is needed to clear PPT? Need at least 31 points for my band 2"
U will need to pass your ICT-IPPT in order to be cleared and is not by just attending.
"Guys,  Can i ask i have upcoming briefing for mr ceremony at air force school in march this year..  Checked my ippt and they said not attempted for current window...pls meet ur ippt requirement by aug 2018..  Does this mean i can siam ippt and go mr straight?  Thanks in advance."
yes. As you happened to MR before the SAF workyear 2018.
"Kumsia bro  Me also happens gg to MR this march ICT, hope they will waive off my ippt this working year"
no need anymore IPPT as your MR will be held before this workyear closure (Apr'18). Unless it is after. congrats.
"If you MRed, no more IPPT for you. Doesn't matter if you clear, no clear. After you MRed, wait for a few days go inside your NS portal. Under IPPT there will put not applicable."
"Hoping some one can help me out here.  Currently ORD for about 2 years already, completed just one ICT. Before I went enlist, I had medical check-up indicating I had Thalassemia, so during CMPB (got a PES B1) phase I reported this up. For some reason, when I mention this to my PC in BMT he says they don't have record. So I went and call and ask, they told me they will check.  Subsequently, I just carried on and got posted out to vocation and then just before I ORD, I went for FFI and then again realised I couldn't find my record. I kinda assumed I couldn't see it but the MO would know.  My hands previously before enlistment had some twitching or shaking, but I chalked it up thinking its normal, but it gotten a lot worse after I ORD. So I went to see a Neurologist, did a scan, and they didn't see anything strange. The diagnosis was that it was essential tremor, which is rare for my age.  At the same time, I've been experiencing this strange pain in my chest, so I just went ahead to see a Cardiologist also, and the scan again didn't reveal much other than abnormal heart veins. Seems like its not a heart or lung issue but something else. Doctor told me to come back 6 months later to review on the 23rd March.  So here is the thing, I failed my previous year IPPT, and need to do RT. But at the same time I had received a 84 days excuse in July to October and another 84 days excuse from November to February. My window close in March 4th and I have no idea what to do, I can't book 20 RT at one go now and my appointment is in March 23rd, so I don think I can ask the doctor to provide me MC or letter to the MO  The MO that I spoke to when I receive my 2nd excuse told me he would look at my Medical Review(Gotten a specialist Memo for my essential tremor), but after 3 months, haven't heard anything.  Should I go and ask for a extension and is there any chance to down PES given my medical conditions?"
"Alternately, what you can do is to report sick during RT/IPT session & they bring you to see FCC MO. Since FCC MO is not a MO from your camp, they can only give you up to around 3 months excuse status for IPPT/IPT/RT. With this, it will help clear this year IPPT/IPT/RT cycle."
"Hi, i supposed this is the correct thread. Already completed 12 RTs. Managed to book another 7 RTs. The dates is just not available for another 1. Maybe cos the window close. During ICT-IPPT, attempted but failed to run 2.4km since bad weather. Just checking, if anyone knows, if i'm considered have completed my RT? I've heard about 75% attendance but don't know whether its true or not."
"For the 20 RT sessions, I would need to finish 17 training sessions and 3 RT-IPPT sessions in total, right?"
yes. basically just take note on which session will be your IPPT and book accordingly.
If let say wanna clear can get money? Sent from 穷挫矮胖永独 using GAGT
"Later this evening, I would have finished my 19th RT training session. When I tried to book my last RT IPPT session, it says that I've attended 18/19 (19/19 when I'm finished later), and I couldn't book the 20th RT session for IPPT (on Saturday). Why is that the case?"
"yes, u can still attend and get the award."
best is to go into ns.sg and see how many RTs you have done and how many left to completion. any ICT-IPPT done or not will be reflected in the total RTs you have to do in you current window.
means you're done. period. you only have to attend 19 sessions instead of 20. congratulations.
I'm counting down the days to see that under the IPPT portal........one more work year to go!!
Mobilisation how many hours must return to camp for main body ah?
"first of all, wrong thread.  secondly, u should know your NTM. If unsure, contact your NS unit. Under main body there are also NTM 'minus' and 'plus'. Therefore, nobody here will be able to advise u."
"Only after bmt will your first window starts, bmt period no count"
Does IPT at Jurong park no more already? Try to book but never saw it
"What do u even mean by ""never saw it""? Is can't find any available sessions or u can't find the place in the park?"
"I mean I try to book IPT, only saw 3 park but Jurong park is not listed last year Sep 2017 still have"
some locations got removed already. i saw a news article on that. u can try to google
"I have done my first IPT-IPPT session. Don't know my PPT level yet but let's assume it is at PPT level: 1  I intend to target for early completion. The website states that in order to early complete, I need to attain my PPT target during my window. Means I need to reach 16-30 points to reach Level 2.  Questions:  1. How can I opt for IPT-IPPT if I am confident enough to clear my PPT level without going through all 10 sessions? Do I book for IPPT or book for IPT session?  2. If I were to attain the required points for my PPT level in one station (e.g. Push Up) but I fail to gain any points (zero) in Sit Up and 2.4, will it still count as early completion?  Thanks for answering!"
"1. U can always book a seperate IPPT via under ""Book IPPT"". 2. U need to have at least 1 point for every station to meet your PPT. So, if not it will not be early completion."
"Never clear RT cannot book IPPT or IPT? my NS portal don't have the booking page.. only can book RT..  Also if i clear my IPPT for this window, will the RT for failing last window IPPT be cancelled?"
boh liao kana removed liao dunno why removed  sian max
The Jurong one not enough people that's why removed ba
"once u are under RT, the only way to do IPPT is during your RT-IPPT, if not ICT-IPPT if u have an ICT coming up. conditions to clear your window is to pass or meet your PPT for your window. Once cleared, your next window will not be a RT."
Do I need to complete all 10 ipt session to get paid?
"as long u had taken part, the payment will be credited in the next few working days.  your attendance will be reflected in the NS portal by the next working day."
Does outwards arm pushups allowed in the IPPT/? taking test at bedok
It has been discontinued since somewhere in November last year due to low attendance. Likewise for Pasir Ris Park.  Everytime I went for my IPT in the park in Jurong there were around 10+ or 20+ participants. quite a pity that it has been discontinued.
What is outwards arm pushup?
I think he meant the elbows bending away from your body.  Most probably no count. They are very strict with the push up posture.
"you're right, i think anything more than 45degrees out from the body is not counted"
"not sure about this, maybe look up on the NS homepage or ask when you go for your next ipt session"
"Hi all, may I check what is the attire to enter FCC for ippt? Going for ippt at bedok fcc soon"
pt attire.. no slippers/scandals.
" Cheers, AltoSax "
Anyone knows whether is there still monetary rewards given for year 0 IPPT?
yes.......
"Thanks, but i heard if you take money for year 0 ippt, no money will be given for year 1 ippt? Can anyone confirm on this?"
Every year have
"Ok, thanks!"
Haha scandals :
yup correct.  obviously it was a typo.
who was the one who told u this info? pls go n correct this friend of yours.
Question here... FFI post 35 is we self book or unit supposed to arrange? Thanks!
your unit will actually be contacting you for arrangements.
Yup i meant arms 90 degrees away from body
"i can't complete my IPT if i don't push. If i go for RT, does it mean it clear 2 working years (this year and next year)?"
"So say even if i pass my IPPT during ICT, i still have to clear all my RT?"
"i had mentioned ""if not ICT-IPPT if u have an ICT coming up"".  This means if u have attended a IPPT during your ICT and passed, u will be cleared of your window including RT."
i have no idea why till now folks here still has the misunderstanding that RT is within 1 or 2 years.  RT requirement is to complete 20-D session within ONE (1) window.  see https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...idelines-rt/rt
"nono...i understand IPT in 1 year window, RT in another 1 year cycle. what i meant was.... By doing RT, i cleared 2 windows of requirements? By completing RT, i cleared 2017 and also 2018 window cycle? what i confuse was RT clearing previous cycle only or clearing 2 years cycle."
Anybody tried asking for extension? Usually extension would given how long. Anybody tried booking rt suddenly unable to commit  Thank you guys for the information
Are RT and IPT sessions essentially the same thing? So if my friend signs up for RT while I sign up for a IPT session on the same day and time we can get to train together?
"is all 1 year.. never ever a 2 years cycle. so to say, if in Year 2 u still cannot complete ""20-D"" RT sessions, in Year 3 u will need to do ""20-D"" again. Where this ""D"" is the number of sessions u have attended in Year 2 Illustration: Year 1 - Attended 5 IPT Year 2 - Required to do: 20-5 = 15 RTs Attended 5 RTs Therefore, in Year 3- Required to do: 20-5 = 15 RTs (plus subjected to more severe disciplinary actions)"
"Thanks for the information, it help a lot. I will complete RT, and drag Year 3 requirement till MR. Joffany wrote: Are RT and IPT sessions essentially the same thing? So if my friend signs up for RT while I sign up for a IPT session on the same day and time we can get to train together? Yes, you can. Subjected to the same color group availability."
"I think, maybe people might have heard of some flaw in the RT system in the past. For the 1st year, you will just fail your ippt at the last day of your current 1st year window, and you will be asked to do RT on the second year window while your second year IPPT window opens. However, after you completed your RT session in the 2nd year, your 2nd year IPPT window is automatically cleared too. Effectively, you will only need to do RT every 2 years. I think laojiao might know what I am talking about here in the early days. If you can pass your IPPT easily, then this is probably not a topic for you. There are even ways to calculate the minimum amount of times you need to go to FCC (which includes risking and the amount of time you can get disciplinary warning from NS + the penalty cost of it). But I will not discuss this here. However, NS.sg update their system 1-2 years ago and required soldiers to attend ippt asap or else face disciplinary action for that year (in term of window). You will need to clear ippt (as pass status, or through completion of ipt/rt) for every window. So, I believe, the patch up the loophole. Actually, I think going for RT/IPT is good. At least a few days of exercise is the healthy choice isn't it."

 Thanks. 10chars

I called ns hotline. The cso say don't need to clear RT after MR. I MR on 1st April but now still can log in to book RT. Is it the system haven't update yet? Read ppl who MR not able to book RT. Should I ignore the RT? My RT window close in June. I already went for a few sessions.
took ippt at khatib fcc.  push up and sit up all use machine alr.  push up machine quite strict
no need for rt after MR
"Took IPPT few days ago at Khatib and the automated push up machine was strict af. apparently it uses an xbox sensor or something as you can see the logo while walking towards the machine.  From what i guess your side posture is also evaluated and any SLIGHT deviation constitutes a no count. I failed in the end lol. I doubt many of the PTs themselves can pass that machine also. We are all not robots, so I don't understand why the machine is expecting us to be one."
Mine just updated today to say I'm not eligible to take IPPT. :p
Me too They still send me msg say I need to attend ippt before my next birthday Nvm I wait for few mth later see how
damnnnnnn. jialat liao. how many no count you kena?
"Sorry, how do I book IPT IPPT on the ns.sg website ah? Cause my first ipt session is a ippt, so when I try to book it's obviously on a ippt day and timing. But how do I let them know that I want to be in the IPT programme?"
"u just have to ensure the session selected does not have ""(No Test)"".  at first your booking will reflect as ""IPT"". but by the next day it would be automatically updated to ""IPT-IPPT"".  try it out"

I did 30+ IPT sessions in my last window. I got paid till my 20th IPT session (I cleared on the 10th)
"sometimes the practice in using manual or electronic can be random, subjected to their manpower availability and the number of participants. Both Bedok and Khatib has the electronic facilities btw."
oh yes u are right. IPT is payable up to 20 sessions. https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...utions-payment

I only got 14 or something. Zero points alamak. More than 15 no counts  Sent from Samsung SM-N950F using GAGT
wtf? many people kena the same?
"I kenna some no counts too. Just spend your first 2-3 pushups correcting your form. Go all the way till the thing beeps, come up for the count. By the 3rd time you should know what the proper form is.  After that you shouldn't get any no counts unless you're damn tired, which means more training needed lor.  what really helps is leaning forward. A lot of people put their palms next to their shoulders. it's easier if it's next to your neh neh."

Nope......
How much does SAF pays a corporal rank Nsmen for each ippt attempt?
"Just wondering, if last year I passed my IPPT, can I still take IPT this year? If I cmi IPT this year, can I still clear my obligations for this year?"

"basically your last day is the day before your birthday.. any Public Holidays or non-working FCC days are not included and therefore, u need to avoid these dates too."
"IPT-IPPT reporting timing is the timing that I booked? (e.g. 1800hrs). So in that sense, they are many different ippt time slots in one evening because there are quite a few ipt-ippt slots to choose from, right?"
"IPT-IPPT is the same as IPT timings,which can be selected under booking of IPT as you need to ensure the selected session does not have the words ""(No Test)"".  usually is during on operating weekdays 6pm & 7pm. And Sat morning 8am and 9am only.  check out under the booking page to understand their avail schedule."
having my 8th RT today which is the IPPT. if i fail the push up. able to fall out straight without taking the 2.4KM? actually i prefer to do RT than doing IPPT.
this depends on FCC itself. some will consider your attendance as invalid.
"Hi, I just ORD in February, and and currently still in year 0. If I do my IPPT now, will I be able to get the monetary incentives? If if so, will I still be able to get the incentives for each successful completion of IPPT for each subsequent year (year 1 and onwards)?"
u will still get the incentives accordingly regardless which Year you are in.
bedok camp still got orange tag for sports/games? for ipt
yes. these are subjected to availability depending on their manpower arrangements and attendance.
No You still have to finish the whole ippt including the 6 rounds of 2.4km They will take everything as your RT training programme for that day itself
anyone going ippt @ khatib this sat at 0730?  my first ippt after ord... lol think sure die facing the machine
"if i cannot complete my RTs (left 2 more only) by my coming bdae, can extend ma ah?"
"now no longer can be extended as the duration to complete has already been revised to 12 months from 10 or less if I am not wrong.  anyway, if window were to let's say be, 24months per window. Definitely there will still be people asking for extension."
Hi. If i take my ipt on my first time. It's always come with test right(it stated your 1st and 10th ipt will come with a test) . If i pass the test do i have incentive like normal Ippt?
"yes, u will still get the award with incentives accordingly.  just take note that when u select your session for booking, it does not have the words ""(No Test)""."
Does anyone know?
"I'm guessing by your ""this year"", you meant your new window.  Then, the answer is Yes you may opt for IPT if you have no confidence of passing IPPT. Think of IPT as the alternative to passing your IPPT.  Completing all 10 sessions is akin to fulfilling your IPPT requirement for the window, you do not have to pass the IPPT at the 10th session. Just complete the 10 sessions. If you cannot complete 10 sessions by your window close, you will be subjected to RT in the next window (20 - D rule applies) with no option to choose IPT."
"Just a quick question, I'm from the SPF, and a friend told me that SAF ippt window is according to the individual's birthdate, and not the Financial Year. Is it really different in the SAF?"
"yes, window open/close on our birthday"
apparently during NSF is tied to workyear. NSmen is birthday
MR already means no need ippt right? Then if also above 35 years old still need to FFI?
Now all is machine sensor? Any pictures or video? Sounds scary
"if u MR before your mandatory FFI age, u do not need any more FFI and IPPT"
just go take one IPPT and that will answer all your questions.
"tink got video de. the machines at the side.  but damn troublesome for those that go there just to fail. the sit up and push up need to lie down there for the full 1 min. unlike last time just do 1 and fk off can le  for 2.4km, one tip for those in the last batch of the day, u can slowly walk. after about 5 rounds (abt 25 min walk), the pti also need to pack up go home so they will ask u to stop and u can save running 1 rd."
haha sibei keng master.
"The push-up is also now machine-based which I did my IPPT last weekend. A briefing is provided in the FCC before you start doing your IPPT. Like what Calender, you do one IPPT to find out  Some of the forum members gave good tips on the push-up station and it helps to do proper forms and get each repetition counted (the platform will vibrate when you do it correctly). You can request for a trial bib to test your push-up form before doing the actual test."
"first time doing ippt after ord, i'll be having my ippt this week at khatib fcc seems like it's raining almost everyday, do we still have to report there if it is raining?"
"Does the IPT in the park at Marina Bay Promontory have a secure place to keep personal belongings?  Or do we have to attend without our personal belongings? cos in camp got locker but in park how?  i booked and i will be going after work from my office, so will have wallet and laptop/bag...."
I was abt to ask u this abt the ffi Thks for the answer
"Need help with some question regarding RT and IPPT pay/reward.  Lets say I fail my IPPT for the current window and I manage to complete my 20 RT, can I retake IPPT for the current window?  Purpose for asking is, I want to get both the RT pay and IPPT reward."
If you think it's going to rain then don't go. You have to retake it if your 2.4 is cancelled. Check weather forecast and look to the skies before you commit an hour at camp.
"yes. u still have to report.  two scenarios. either mindef will send u sms on the cancellation (very rare) if weather can be foreseen and confirm), or u might be asked to book a separate ippt for 2.4km run only.  the above only applies when there is a very bad weather.  however, if u are taking as a ipt-ippt, 2.4km might be exempted and attendance still taken."
"Nope. Once RT or IPPT (pass) is done, your obligations for that window has been satisfied. Best scenario is to maintain that fitness level and whack ippt once window reopens."
"after completing your 20 RTs, u can take a non-ICT IPPT within the same window (as u are no longer subjected to RT program). only in-between during your 20 RTs, u cannot book a non-ICT IPPT. Unless, it is an ICT-IPPT as is during your ICT. BUT... all forms of IPPT allowance (1/2 day service pay for attendance) only allows up to 3 sessions. In this case, u would already had 3 sessions of RT-IPPT. what qualifies you for extra money is if u pass your IPPT with incentives or higher, depending on what you got for RT-IPPT."
"Does the IPT in the park at Marina Bay Promontory have a secure place to keep personal belongings?  Or do we have to attend without our personal belongings? cos in camp got locker but in park how?  i booked and i will be going after work from my office, so will have wallet and laptop/bag...."
placed in open area and their will be one instructor looking-after
"Answered all my question and even those that I had not considered, thank you for the well-detailed respond. idjekyll wrote: Nope. Once RT or IPPT (pass) is done, your obligations for that window has been satisfied. Best scenario is to maintain that fitness level and whack ippt once window reopens. Yes, but I want to get both IPPT money and RT money, call me cheap but who doesn't wanna get paid to keep fit"
"there is a number to call to check cat status. google ""saf weather cat status phone number""  but i dunno what sector number does khatib camp fall under."
"if u just want attendance to be clocked, just go.  if u want to chiong and pass, then check the weather first. if not can go other camp, i know maju is sheltered area for 2.4 so no problem raining or storm also can do"
Just received a call from mindef saying that my ipt has not complete yet and say that I can take up some program from Health promotion board at area outside of army camp and consider as 1 ipt.  But he didn't explain clearly and just say that I can go to health promotion board website to apply and find out more information.  Anybody know about that? I can't find any info from the website.

I ORD-ed in November last year. My birthday is in June. If i take my IPPT in May and in July do I get paid for both?
"Incentive, yes, since it's for different windows.  Rank pay I believe will get also."
yes.........
Does anyone happen to know if I can default my last one or two cycles of IPPT/RT/IPT if I'm expected to MR next year? I have never defaulted so it seems like it'd be a safe consideration. Wondering if they will use it as reason to not MR personnel haha
"Hi guys, I will be doing my last cycle ict end of may month and coming mid of june will be my new ippt window period. Do i still need to do ippt since i already completed my ict?"
"wah shiok, got ROD cert and watch liao ah?"
Nope not yet... Just want to check in advance... Skali they fault me for not doing ippt etc all that... Mindef a lot of stun one -_- ... I don't own them they don't own me.
"by right yes.  As your final in-camp is end-May 2018, your expected IPPT window will be valid until end-Mar 2019 (according to fiscal year). Unless, your MR ceremony is on Apr 2019 or after."
I signed up for the E1PEP ipt before I know need to pay for the gym fees. Anyone know how to withdraw from this scheme ah?
Do anyone knows if Kranji FCC also used the automated machine for the Push-Up station? (Just like Khatib and Maju FCC?)
"Anyone went to khatib fcc recently? Is there still an orange tag for games?  I'm also due for my HSP since i'll be 35 soon but still no SAF100 issued for it, anyone know where to get the SAF100 for it?"
"orange tag yes. maybe u have yet to receive SAF100 only. otherwise, contact your unit via NS Hotline to enquire."
Yes just went there 2 weeks ago for Ippt.  Both sit up and push up use machine
How is the 2.4km route like for Kranji Camp? Do you run 6 rounds stadium running track like Khatib Camp?
"2.4 is indoor, the large vehicle carpark. Basically a rectangle, except for one corner that sticks out."
How many rounds do you run around the carpark?
does anyone know where is the IPT conducting area for the Marina Bay Promontory?  My first time going later this evening but not sure where to meet later for the IPT. Promontory quite big and crowded
6 rounds. The straights are supposedly longer.
"Marina City Gallery @ Marina Bay https://www.ns.sg/web/wcm/connect/ns...y-city-gallery honestly speaking, there isn't easily avail info on the location of IPT-in-the-park. feedback to NS portal is necessary."
"Thanks! yea more info should be provided in SMS reminders....will feedback to NS portal too. Plus, when booking it states Promontory.... city gallery and promontory is 2 different places lor"
still walking distance between the two though. Just need someone to confirm on the exact location.
"Hi guys. If I were to book ipt training but on that day unable to make it,is there a maximum session I can miss?"
no issues at all. and there is no limit how many you can miss.

Anyone know typically what time does the IPT end for the Tues/Thurs 1230pm sessions in Bedok and Khatib?
"all FCCs are the same.. roughly about 60mins in total (15mins of in-pro + 45 exercise & out-pro). Therefore, by 1:30pm you should be off."
Yes for both 1 and 3
"If I passed my ippt just before my birthday, can I immediately take my ippt after my new window open or is there a cooldown period?"
u can go ahead and take.
Am I able to amend my IPPT test date to the upcoming day (24 May) afternoon session? Will the attendance be updated?
i do not think afternoon session has IPPT test.
" I updated around 11pm last night, will the attendance list he updated? "
Ya. If your nsportal say updated mean updated.

Come in at Saturday 12am.
"14 days. u rushing to use that incentive for lottery?  and do not even need to worry. Mindef will not ""eat"" that incentive or allowance. And u will be receiving an SMS to inform u on the payment."
"I took my IPPT at kranji camp, the new machine systems they implement is really a pain in the ass. Any movements not following the right posture immediately not counted. Lol. My window is closing, anyone know if Maju camp is using manual or machine?"
"Guys,  On the NS portal, I received a notification informing me about the chances of getting charged IF I fail to complete my RT's before 2nd of June next upcoming week. So I was thinking to myself, will I still be considered liable if I took the the Ippt-test ON THAT DAY itself AND passed?   Anyone?"
"  Just took at maju camp, got fked by machine too, more than half of my push up not counted although im certain my posture should have counted for most of them."
"For IPPT after ORD, do I have to do all 3 stations or can I choose not to do the 2.4 run if I know I cannot pass it based on the static station results?  I went for RT last year and they made us do all the stations (including 2.4 run) for the first attempt but maybe non-RT IPPT is different."
Maju is machine. Had to use three attempts for the push up station.  STRAIGHTEN BACK STRAIGHTEN BACK STRAIGHTEN BACK LOWER BODY LOWER BODY STRAIGHTEN BACK
How about Safra jurong? Any idea also implemented? Sian
u have to do all stations to get the attendance even if u know u sure fail. u just can walk the 2.4....most of us who fail also walk...
Mind sharing what kind of activity or exercise you do at IPT session?
"For IPTs inside the FCCs (army camps), it's the same as RT.  You choose what colour tag you want, and do the corresponding exercises the PTI tells you to.  Red: Cardio (Running + a bit of static for upper body/core/lower body strength) Yellow: Static exercises (for overall strength conditioning) Blue: Fitness challenge (circuit training, IMO it's xiong Yellow) Orange: Games (Soccer, etc etc) Green: For obese personnel. More of a weight-loss thing if I understand it correctly."
"as long u managed to pass your RT-IPPT (only if you are under RT), or an ICT-IPPT, you will be considered as ""cleared"" your window and no charges will be filed against you."
"If I completed my IPT cycle for this window already, and still book IPT will I get paid? XD"
Last day of taking my ippt today. Window close tmr.  Usually I do during Ict but the past yr no Ict so now got to go maju do it myself. I just found out now push up is use machine. Is it really so strict that alot of ppl fail?  Push up is my weakness sia.
Just finish Ict. The push up machine is really strict.  Does anyone know if Ict-ippt is using the push up machine too?
"I think for ICT IPPT, it depends on the unit. My unit uses manual counting previously....  I also got screwed by the push up machine. Anyone knows if they use the machines over at SAFRA IPPT?"
Jurong safra ippt manual sit-up and push up. Last went was in Feb

do i have to report to the fcc if im not feeling well for ippt or will it consider as a fail or a chargeable offence if i dont attend at all?

"currently on my last week of BMT, my company has finished 16km route march and i’ve not done 12km yet due to sick leaves and falling out. they will be doing 24km this week and i will probably be doing 12km. will there be RT for route march? like during block leave or in unit life (in mono intake)"
there can be a deployment of u doing the 12km with other companies if there is available and upon approval. And RT for route march is quite rare due to the amount of resources require.
A question. E1-PEP payment Is for 10 session or for a year. There’s no way I can reach ipt on a freaking 7pm. I need to work man.  Also do IPT 10 Times can liAo right. Don’t need to pass.
"This thread for people already ORDed, wake up idea leh"
I asking about IPT and E1-PEP... I ord long ago zzz. I said I working. You wake up your idea lei.
"Sorry quote wrong guy, should have been the route march guy  BTW my time in 2008 24km route march not a requirement to pass out BMT, only range, grenade and field camp needed, but dunno about now since SAF change pattern more than badminton every time"
"Anyone has any idea if you passed a non ict ippt and subsequently you failed your ict ippt during the same window, is it sill considered a pass for that window?"
just took my IPPT today at Bedok FCC. majorly screwed by the machine. lol only 12 push ups counted.. past 3 years all do 30+
I think must 100% standard push up
"Not true. Please do a half rep/half f*ck rep and reap the benefit after ward. Please do not do full rep, or else you will suffer all the way.  The new machine sucks and people who slack/do half **** will easily make 60 reps. Tips from the tester...  The previous setup using another person's fist as standard is so much better."
"Never hear this type of case before.  Anyway you should log into NS Portal and check. By right, the moment you passed the non-ICT IPPT, the system should have already logged in that pass. So if you fail IPPT during ICT, even if in the same window, also should be considered pass liao."
"frostiee wrote: Not true. Please do a half rep/half f*ck rep and reap the benefit after ward. Please do not do full rep, or else you will suffer all the way.

Yeah, agree that the machine a bit weird weird. I see some people the butt never move, just the upper body, and go down also like half f*ck, still counted."
"Just wanna ask, those borderline people who manage to pass during RT or IPT, after passing in current window, do you all actually just book IPT voluntarily to maintain so that can pass when next window opens? Or do you all do own training then try to pass when next window opens?  Cos I just managed to clear recent RT-IPPT. First time in many many years liao . But I know if I try to do own training outside, sure slack and eventually never do.  My next window and last ICT (can finally say MR loh! soon ) coming up in 2 months. If I book IPT sessions now, at least got people to train me and got people to train together with, not so sian.  Go IPT, got NS pay also right like RT? I know RT still got NS pay, can cover public transport fees, unless driving, then only subsidize the car fuel a bit niah."
"yes, i use IPT to force myself to work out, and also clear the liability at the same time. i'm a lazy person, and got charged many times already, so better be smart about this. 10 IPT is better than 20 RT if i default. i schedule IPT towards the end of my window and i do put in effort in the sessions. so if i pass the IPPT at the last session, i know i can repeat it when my new window opens shortly. i just have to maintain. also 3-station IPPT is much easier to train."
"Okok. I will go schedule IPT also. I know moi physical not very good, but when I go RT, see some people even worse than me, some how, moi feel relieved and happy . Now want to try aim for pass with incentive. I think 2-3 more pushups, and 2-3 more situps, then chiong 10-20 more secs on 2.4km, can get incentive and some extra kopi $."
"Hi all. I just recently ORD in May. I opened up my NS portal one day and I saw that my IPPT window is open and the status is NOT TAKEN.  From my understanding, the window will only open after the first birthday after ORD and my birthday is in Feb. So I thought I can only attempt after my birthday in Feb next year.  I cleared my IPPT last July when my 2nd year window opened and thus I did not attempt any IPPT in 2018.  Seeking opinions on all the lao jiaos here. Can I attempt this IPPT and will there be any monetary incentive to it? Or do I have to wait until next year Feb to attempt for the monetary incentive?  Want to clarify because if can attempt I will do it because now still fit and the incentive is bao jiak hahaha. Thanks in advance everyone!"
Cycle 0 is optional but got money.
"Hi bro, thanks for the info. So if I clear this time round, come Feb next year after my birthday do I have another to clear?"
"Hi guys quick question. Didn't go for my ippt last year and got charged. Let off with a warning. Suppose to go for 20 RT sessions didn't go for any. Getting charged next month, what to expect? Will it just be a fine and how much?"
"Good on you, bro! Just to add on, there is also NS (rank) pay for IPT. 10 sessions compared to 20, get money... pretty good deal IMO."

"Just booked IPT at khatib FFC for aquatic session, anyone go before?Siong mah har?"
Is IPT-IPPT (First session of IPT must be IPPT) results considered as IPPT result?  Seems to make sense that the results should be counted if passed/get awards. But is it correct?
"If you can pass IPPT, you don't need to take IPT. As I understand it, once you start on IPT, you need to finish the 10 sessions. The results do count as IPPT results if I am not wrong, but if you pass it on the first try, it loops back to my first point, so I'm not really sure what you're trying to get at (any help is welcome here). EDIT: Refer to Calander's post above. Else, you can always check with the PTIs when you're there."
"if u were to passed IPPT during your 1st IPT-IPPT, u will be cleared from your window."
Temp excuse rmj 6 months. Like that means no need do ippt?
Btw kranji FCC is use machine for pushup situp
"Can I check how many RT sessions I need to do?  I always thought total is 20 sessions but when I checked, the system in NS portal says I need to complete 18 sessions and that I have done 16 out of 18 sessions. At first, I thought it was because of the 2 Rt-IPPT sessions I taken and were not counted among the 16 sessions, but I counted the 'Current Window Attendance' record and the 2 RT-IPPT sessions were indeed among the 16 sessions already taken."
"Bedok FCC also.  firsttimebuyer wrote: Can I check how many RT sessions I need to do?

If you defaulted IPPT in the previous window, it is 20 sessions (the absolute max). Otherwise, its 20 - (no. of IPPT taken and failed/no. of IPT sessions completed) in the previous window. If your max is 18 this year, then I am assuming you took IPPT/IPT twice in the previous window.  RT-IPPT or IPT-IPPT sessions are counted in this number."
You know which FCC no machine?
"Actually, no hahaha. I'm assuming they'd roll out machines at FCCs FIRST... camps then maybe longer? Can always crowdsource for info here."
is there anyway for us to trial e machines without booking a slot?
http://theleadingpride.com/2018/03/20/how-to-beat-the-ippt-eliss-system/
Got a question I haven go to any RT session and my window close on AUG And i this year MR liao So what will happen ar?
At khatib fcc how they determine which day to have purple tag or not?
"Can check with you guys, am I able to extend my rt window by a month?"
"Cut-off year from MR is every Apr..  By right Aug'18 to Apr'19 u are still liable for IPPT due to financial work year.  However given that ur MR ceremony is this year (before end-2018 i assume), usually they will just let u go"
"Anyone did IPT in the park in punggol park? is it fun?  kind of bored of the same old ""squats, burpees, burpees burpees burpees squats"" ""train your core, train your core, train your core, train your core, train your core"""
If ICT during birthday can have early off or leave?
u can request it to your OC.
Used to be able to do that by talking to the RT instructors and admin. But since they've made RT a year long process maybe not possible now. Better to ask them next time you go for a session.
when will receive information for mobs manning?  standing by these 2 weeks  1st mobs and unit is put IDTI
wad info are u even looking for? - notification for mob manning is 6mths - manning activation is on the day itself - u are supposed to stand-by during the stated duration with your equipment - info on what equipment to prepare u should get from your unit - info on codeword for activation u should also consult from your unit - info on where is IDTI u should be asking your unit btw this is IPPT thread.. not Mob Manning or activation
Anyone has any idea how Long does it take for IPPT taken during ICT to be reflected on ns.sg?
around 5 working days for results.  for incentive/awards payment should be 14 working days.
"Now IPPT/IPT no more 7pm slot ? I checked all FCC from now till Sept (my window closing) only have 1700hours slot. Last time 6pm leave work still can chiong to FCC for 7pm slot, now they remove how to reach FCC at 1700hours ?!  Btw, to enrol into IPT, i just have to schedule IPPT first , complete it and then select IPT session ? or Do i need to enrol specifically into IPT ?"
Guys newbie here. How many Ipt sessions can you book in a week. Is it same as rt (48hours apart).
Please don't book non-ICT IPPT. Just book IPT normally and don't book it on a Monday because FCC doesn't conduct IPPT on Monday. We're unable to convert IPPT into IPT-IPPT.
"Thanks. When you mention to book IPT normally, you mean for me to book IPPT on my first session, reach there and tell the admin personnel that I am enrolling for IPT and this is my first IPT-IPPT ?  A bit confusing, because i do not see the enrollment for IPT only. The option only states IPPT/IPT/RT. When I went to see the available slots, I can only see 5pm on weekdays slots.  EDIT: Found the enrol for IPT button."
"Yes. Book IPT. Your first session is IPPT and they will usually give instructions on where to queue, etc etc (at least, the OC at Bedok does), which basically just means you queue up to inpro at the IPPT counter. And yes, you can mention it's your first session to them just to confirm. 2nd session to 9th, you inpro at the RT/IPT counter. 10th is same as first. About your earlier post, I did a 1900 weekday session recently (like within the past month). Unless all the slots were already booked... If you have to go for the earlier one, perhaps you need to work things out with your superior at work. I believe it can be done."
"7pm weekday slots are still available. Just that I have to enrol into IPT specifically then I am able to see the slots. The new web interface is so confusing, lol."
"7pm slot is still available.  Make sure when u select the session, it does not have the words ""NO IPPT"" indicated above the time slot when u are booking the 1st and 10th session of IPT. All bookings is to be done under ""Book IPT"".  Also, do make sure the FCC u select is the correct one because for me, mistakes happened in selecting the wrong FCC under this new interface."
"does anyone knows is there any black and white directive that during ICT, nsmen diedie must go for the ICT IPPT? if dont go will get charge straightaway?"
"there aren't any black n white on this. But they will have the statistics on the total strength for the Unit undergoing ICT, number of participants for IPPT and number of participants who passed or awarded with higher award etc. The respective Div HQ and Mindef looks at the statistics of these to rate the unit's performance and management."
"When they generate name list for ICT, it will include IPPT list.  Taking IPPT is easy. Take static stations is easy. 2.4km, you can literally walk/jog 1 round, then fall out.  Taking IPPT while avoiding having to stay in the night before (a mandatory requirement) is a bit harder and requires finesse."
"Depends on unit.  Some units that are ON about winning Best Unit Competition may make ICT IPPT one of their key activity. Non-participation in key activity can be marked fail.  Anyway take part only what, doesn't mean you have to pass."
"Thanks for the reply  yea i know just take only its quite simple but cause my camp is at changi air base and i stay at west coast. The ippt starts at 745am which i cannot make it on time. Told them that but they say its my problem, damn fk up  plus i alr booked my own ippt slot after my ICT period at maju camp"
take cab?? hello. u never go airport in wee hours b4?
speak to your OC to excuse u from the ICT-IPPT. They can understand. My question to u is... u cant stay-in?
U wan me to spend $30 on a cab just for a ippt when I can just pass outside  Calander wrote: speak to your OC to excuse u from the ICT-IPPT. They can understand.  My question to u is... u cant stay-in? I tried but the CO reject he say not his problem that we stay far Can't stay in
"Can't stay in good what. Like that also not happy? Just wake up early and take first train/first bus lor. If you want to sleep more, then spend $ on cab lor. Or see if you can lompang car ride from any one who stays nearby. Just treat them breakfasts/tea breaks to cover their fuel. They get to eat, you save on cab fare. Win win. If you want to avoid, next time clear your IPPT liabilities before ICT. Then ask to be excused. No guarantee, but at least it should increase your chances. In before beh kan, no car to drive for ICT."
mine is the opp. some people want to take also cannot.
"anyone know why IPT in the park is so hard to book?  went to the friday session in punggol. pretty good workout.  straight to the lesson, no ******** lame warm ups, circuit training for 13mins, 12 mins of running.  i like it."
"unless ur ict takes place during ur bday, u shld have taken it b4 ur ict."
Are RT sessions being paid and how much are being paid ? According to rank ?
"Both RT and IPT will pay.  Just book what you need. As long as your details are updated in the system, you will receive SMS informing you of payment, just like ICT.  Then just login to NS portal to check actual amounts, and which account is it credited to.  If you take public transport, the $ more than covers transport + some makan. If driving, the $ helps in covering fuel.  If you can pass with incentive, be it RT IPPT or IPT IPPT, also can get $."

"if wihtin a year , mindef never call u up, is it considered ORNS cycle? The strange thing is they counted that year as ORNS cycle."
"Adding on, it's 1/2 day rank pay. Although it does vary a bit; there's about one dollar difference between the maximum and minimum pay that I have received so far. I am curious as to the reason why, personally."
ORNS cycle is defined as 7HK + 3LK of ICT or otherwise until the statutory age to ROD.  mindef can have no NSmen called up for even 10 over years too. the disadvantage for this group of NSmen is that they will need to keep doing IPPT if eligible until the age of 40.
"Hi bros, newbie here. Been following this thread a while but never registered and post.  Wanted to ask if anyone know the special RT/IPT programs (e.g. spinning, martial arts) held at each FCC and which day/time they are held? TIA."
"The pay is depending on how many working days are there in a month The more working days, the less pay."
Sorry no section for SPF/SCDF here. I wanted to do IPT in the Park/SAFRA gym but there isnt any option if not SAF. Cannot do IPT in any camp either and they close down ITE East. So I need to go to CCK when I live in the East. 2 hours of MRT and bus to reach there  Anyone know why ITE East cannot do IPT/RT there anymore? Lucky you all SAF reservist!
"these activities will be considered as ""orange tags"" which you can request during in-pro. however, this tag should be available at 6pm and 7pm IPT/RT at FCCs if I am not wrong. nevertheless, u would be having either a maximum of 8 non-IPPT IPT, or a maximum of 17 non-IPPT RT in your annual window. this means that u have a lot of opportunities to try out the various colour tags available and how IPT/RT system works."
https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/site/mh...lter=spf-nsmen
Thanks. I just went for my first RT session at Maju FCC and they have orange tag only for Tuesday and Thursday 1800 session. This month is kick-do (kickboxing and taekwando?) Anyway I didn't take the orange tag because I wasn't interested. Anyone know what other orange tag activities are offered in the other FCCs? Heard each FCC is different and they rotate each month.
Orange tag at Khatib? It's Soccer or hand rugby and that's my time then
1st world problem ma . u can always pitch a sleeping bag in camp at one quiet corner .
I saw a poster for some K-Pop aerobics thingy at Bedok FCC a few months back... not sure if it's still applicable or not. If any bros have updated info please do share.  Won't be going back there till mid-August at the earliest.
"If I book a normal IPPT is it counted as a 1st IPT session if I fail? If not, I might as well book IPT IPPT as my first session in case I fail right?"
"IPPT and IPT IPPT is recorded differently under the system. So if you book and fail IPPT, it is recorded as IPPT fail, but not as an IPT session.  But if I am not wrong, if you book 1st IPT session (which is IPPT), and then you pass, then should be exempted liao from IPT liao.  You can contact hotline to confirm."
"Yes. If you pass the IPT IPPT, it's considered as a normal pass i.e. you fulfill your requirements for that cycle. If you fail, the results will be used to determine your PPT."
"hi guys, i see on the NS website that i need to complete 0/19 RT sessions.  So i just finish all these 19 sessions and im done? am hearing diff things from people, some telling me i have 20 actually?  thanks in advance"
"To clarify, PPT means Personal Performance Targets. Read more about it here: https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...es-for-ipt/ppt  fudgie wrote: hi guys, i see on the NS website that i need to complete 0/19 RT sessions.  So i just finish all these 19 sessions and im done? am hearing diff things from people, some telling me i have 20 actually?  thanks in advance You must have taken and failed IPPT once in the previous work year. Hence, your RT/IPPT obligation this work year is 20 - 1 = 19 sessions. Finish it all and you're done.  There will be RT-IPPT on your 8th, 14th and (I think) 19th session. If you pass RT-IPPT on the 8th or 14th session, it is also considered as having cleared your obligations for this work year."
"just to check , have all camp started using machine sensitivity to count for the push up instead of manpower now?"
Camps used for IPPT/RT/IPT for reservists confirm use machines.  I think most if not all camps used for ICT now have the new machines also..
If going to start bmt but can't do push up how ?  PTP batch  My upper limb muscle is very small  now is at single digit push up
need not worry about this. BMT will be training u for it
"Moi was zero fighter (zero pullups) when I went in 5 month BMT, eons ago. Before the end of 5 months, could do 15 pull-ups. So no fear. Just work hard in training, cos you will have a lot of kakis also in bad physical shape like you. Remember to always take care and always safety first."
"siao liao, my running also cannot make it Just did a 2.4 , turn out to be 20 mins"
Is it possible to retry IPPT if I had passed it on my 14th RT session? Or does the window automatically close upon passing?
"when u are under RT for that window which u are in, u can only do IPPT only on RT-IPPT or ICT-IPPT.  only when u cleared your 20-D RT sessions, u will be deemed cleared from your window regardless pass or fail"
"Yep, the 14th RT was my 2nd RT-IPPT. Since I have passed, does that mean I don't have to clear the remaining 5 sessions? If I feel like trying for Pass w/Incentive or Silver, can I go for the remaining sessions while still getting half day service pay?"
"My guess is can. I also passed RT-IPPT on 14th RT session. But I did not go for the remaining sessions, and went to manually cancel the RT sessions in the system. Since the system does not automatically cancel the RT sessions when one passes RT-IPPT that promptly, my guess is should be able to still go. But not sure also, cos the system also auto sms me to inform me that I have cleared my RT liabilities. So you try and let us know. Keep the RT sessions in the system, and don't cancel them. If you are still getting the SMS reminders to go for the RT sessions, then I believe that means still can go."
"Yes, the SMS notification still came in for the remaining RT sessions. I had contacted NS Hotline and they said it is okay to ignore the remaining sessions. Anyway, I am more concerned about doing one more IPPT to try for the incentive than the RT sessions."
"If you had passed your RT-IPPT on the 8th or 14th session, do allow the system some time to update your window status to RT completed. After that, your option to book non-ICT IPPT will be open."
Not sure if this is the correct thread to ask! Sorry if it’s not! But may I know how long is the programme on the day of enlistment for visitors? My brother will be enlisting at 8am hence by what time will guests be back to Pasir Ris?  Thank you so much for your help! Appreciate it !
"I see. It's already updated and there's an option to book IPPT. However, I can only book 1 slot. Is this normal? My RT window only closes in October."
"IPPT can book multiple de meh?  Book once, if pass, no need to book again, if fail, then book again."
"for ippt at safra, punggol safra  after our test will we be given a physical hard copy of our results like fcc ippt?  anybody knows?"
"Anyone able to give a review of using machines vs. PTIs themselves? Only a few years ago, many of my friends complain about the PTIs being very niao about push-up standard. After the machines were in place, they are all dying to have the PTIs back."

"Hello bros,  So I failed my IPPT last year and did not go for the 19 RT sessions. My closing window is next month.  I'm working in the media industry so i've been super super swarmed with work, OT almost everyday completely forgotten about going for RT.  Will I face any serious charges if I get called to CMPB because they might assume I did not make any effort to complete my RT at all? This is my first time if I do get charged.  Please help!"
"First time will be warning. When they charge you first time, can be at CMPB, or at your unit camp, or during ICT if there is an upcoming ICT. So far, I have never heard of people kenna first charge and fined. But kenna fine is the worst case scenario for first time charge. Unless you really go and shoot back at them gaolat gaolat. If you do that, you will confirm hong gan gao gao. If you get called to CMPB, its also not confirmed that you definitely will get fined. I went CMPB before to answer charge, no fine. But basically, your fate is in the hands of the officer-in-charge. If you show guai lan face and talk back, then of course kena fine or worse is a possibility. Now, after clearing the first charge, its up to you liao. If you bochup again the next year or two, of course, be prepared to face charge again and kenna fined again. If you don't want to give $ to SAF, then you must plan your RT now. If you are totally CMI case, confirm cannot pass on the 8th or 14th RT session, that means you have to go for the full 20 RT sessions. Well, actually its 17 RT and 3 RT-IPPT (8th,14th,20th). Lets say you go for the full 20 sessions. If you go once every weekend, you clear your IPPT liabilities in 20 weeks. If you can squeeze out 1 weekday, then you clear in 10 weeks. If you are getting up there in age, and very long never do exercise, never even go kick football or play bball, then I sincerely advise you to do some light workouts at home, since right now, you may not be able to book RT sessions, until you finish the charge process. Just do like 5-10 pumping. Or wake up on weekend, do like 10 minute jogging before you jiak breakfast. This is to slowly work your body into some physical shape. Thus, you reduce the risk of injury. If you suddenly do RT exercise, can get injured de. Moi tio injury during RT. Heng, I had enough time to recover, before continuing RT and passing on the 14th RT-IPPT. Ownself should ownself know own body. So take care always, think safety always. Yes, starting the RT process is super duper sian and marhuan, and really throws a kink into your schedule. Everyone knows. The only hard part is clearing your work schedule enough to start. Once you start, its very easy liao. You basically can just show face at RT, go through the motions can liao. If you want to quickly pass and avoid going more RT sessions, then of course you will have to put in effort. After you clear RT, can consider the IPT process, since its much shorter, only 10 sessions niah. RT or IPT, you still get paid. So it helps cover public transport (plus makan) totally or partially helps cover fuel costs if taking motorbike or car. Haiz, what to do? Born in SG ish like that de. NS for sinkies, jobs for FTs. Good luck on your charge."
"Hi guys, I'm in the midst of clearing 19 RT sessions. I have already taken one RT-IPPT on the 8th session of RT. When I tried to book the 14th session of RT, the system does not state the session as RT-IPPT. I would like to check when would the next RT-IPPT session be held?  The system does state that ""Your last RT session should be scheduled on a date with IPPT."". So does this mean that the 19th session of RT is RT-IPPT, and not the 14th session?"
"System issue bah. I remember it was the same case for me this year. Then I checked back again and the RT-IPPT status showed. As long as the system has clocked all your RT sessions properly, then no fear. Any issue, just tell the people in charge. If they see in the system its the 14th session for you, they will allow you to register at the IPPT queue."
I think the PTI is stricter than the machine.

"Hi guys, for spf pnsmen RT-IPPT session is follow the 8th ,14th and 20th sessions right??? i have attended my 7th RT session , but ns portal still state that i am ineligible to book rt-ippt for my 8th session??"
your attendance for the 7th RT will only be updated in the system about 3-4 days. Only afterwhich you will be allowed to book for RT-IPPT
I got tis issue too..i attended 19/19.. and when i took my 19th session..the outpro slip showed next session is ippt..but i cant book any ippt or rt-ippt in the portal..my window is closing in 2weeks times. Anyone encounter this issue before?
"Pls ignore the message on the out pro slip as you have completed your RT (20 - 1). 1 is the Non ICT IPPT session that you taken and failed on your last window. However, you must have attempted 1 x RT IPPT either on the 8 or 14 session to fulfil the RT requirement ( at least 1 RT IPPT within the RT window)."
Thanks spiddy for clarification. I received this msg from mindef  (Fm: MINDEF) Please be informed that you have fulfilled your RT requirement for this window. Please continue to stay fit.
Can NSF vote in GE?  Let's say over the age of 21 and still serving NS.  Eld site say Singaporean but bracket up pink ic.  NSF do not hold Pink ic but 11B  so not very sure here  http://www.eld.gov.sg/voters.html

"Guys, just to check, if I were to enlist on this Friday at BMTC school 2, which company will I get ?  Am slot and PTP batch"
"u will only know on the day itself, unless there are your unit commanders here in this forum. However, they are not allowed to reveal such information. Do understand what is OSA about otherwise you might get charged for it on such related offences. Recently there is a paramedic got charged under this act for your info. Nevertheless, what company you get in, how does it matter? Furthermore, this thread is IPPT-related.

"When I was booking my RT, I was prompted to schedule my 8th 14th and 20th RT session on a IPPT day.  So will I be required to take IPPT during my 8th 14th and 20th session, as opposed the normal RT? Anyway to skip the IPPT? If it's not skippable, will there be allowance for attending IPPT?  Sent from Xiaomi MI A1 using GAGT"
"Yes, IPPT on 8th,14th and 20th is mandatory de. Adjust your bookings accordingly. Avoid Saturday RT-IPPT to avoid the weekend IPPT crowd."
Hi just curious is the ipt session at fcc tougher in general compared to those conducted in parks? Cos I heard the ipt in fcc may follow rt session
Yes IPT in FCC follow RT session if it's during RT timeslot. Tougher or not I don't really know.
"Thanks, and thank you for the advice. What about service pay, do they pay me for going to IPPT like normal RT? Sent from Xiaomi MI A1 using GAGT"
"Same, no different from other RT sessions, iirc."
"One more question, do I go to the RT inpro or IPPT inpro when taking RT-IPPT?  Sent from Xiaomi MI A1 using GAGT"
"IPPT in-pro. No need scared. If you forget and go to the RT inpro when its your 8th,14th or 20th, the staff will auto direct you to the other queue. Thats what I encounter at the Bedok Camp FCC."
"Thank you, you've been a great help. Sent from Xiaomi MI A1 using GAGT"
"On Thursday, I have booked IPPT @ maju for today, then on Friday I cancelled maju and booked bedok, because i suddenly need to deliver my goods to the east side, so can't make it for maju.  So today I went to bedok, they scanned my ic and said i didn't book for bedok, and even showed me their computer record that I booked IPPT @ maju for today."
"all updated records shall be as per your NS Portal Booking page. and which computer are u even referring to? The one in FCC or guardroom?? If FCC, it shall be the same as your NS Portal. For guardroom, the records are until a certain cut-off time as they need to retrieve the bookings about a day before the session. So what is your conclusion which you failed to mentioned - did your or did you not done your session at Bedok FCC? Please give your conclusion if you want to share your story. Thanks."
anyone know if still able to extend RT window?
"My ns portal show I only need to attend 19 rt session, I know rt ippt is on the 8,14 and 20th session but the ns portal got one big red banner that say must book “last rt session” on rt ippt date Since I only need to attend 19 only, do I attends my 19/19 session as a normal rt or do I need to attend it as a rt ippt since it’s my “last rt session”"
"Really don't know why your case like that de. Think better you call and ask bah. Or if you don't want to be put on hold, then just go and ask the staff when you go for your next RT. Ask them why your case like that."
"Guys, I have to complete another 19 RT sessions by 16 October 2018.  I completed 1 session, so I'm left with 7 more sessions before I can take RT IPPT session. If I pass on that 8th session before 16 October, I don't need to attend anymore RT and I'm safe from any disciplinary actions right?  Thanks guys!"
yes that is correct
"Question about IPPT and MR. This year will be my last ICT, so going MR. But I still owe RT and IPPT. So, my question is once MR this Sept, do I still need to clear this year's IPPT cycle?"
"By right cut-off month for the financial year is April.  So to say, MR in Sep'18 and your birthday is on or before 31 Mar'19, u need to do.  However, usually this part of the policy is not being enforced because u are MR-ing and in a way, to give-in to u in recognition of your service.  Therefore, u can still take IPPT, but there will be no issue for defaulting."
What happens if I book IPPT but never attend or manage to cancel my booking?
"Nothing happens. It simply lapses.  Of course, if you don't do anything else and your window closes, that's a different story altogether... heh heh heh"
Now RT or IPT still got service pay?
Hi guys. I have attended 16 sessions and i can only book 2 more sessions before my window closes for RT. Is there any way I can extend the window for 3 more days? And I can't find anywhere in the NS portal regarding my unit's contact number/email.
u should be contacting NS portal to have your unit to contact u.
"HI guys, my IPPT window close on 20th oct this year and i have only go for one rt. i will be going reservist on the month of oct and if i pass my in camp ippt before my windows close, do i still need to go for rt? am i allow to take the in camp ippt in the first place?"
"u can still take ICT-IPPT and only if u pass, u will be cleared from your window.  Otherwise, RT."

"After 40th birthday(January 2019), still need to clear ippt or not?"
"no need, unless u are an officer."
"Ok, thank you!"
I have booked a RT session for this morning but can’t go due to work commitments. Any penalty for it??
"One time, no problem.  Last time, if you miss 3 or more, liable to kena. Now, not sure. I don't think got that ruling anymore.  So just go for your next RT session. Book your RT sessions according to your schedule. You can always reschedule, but I remember the system will block you from rescheduling if less than 24 hours, or maybe its 48 hours.  If your window is closing or something, than got issue. But then, you only have to ask for continuance, and then cite work commitments. No need to think about it too much. Just clear your RT liabilities as best you can."
"Hi, been getting mixed answers from my friends on whether I need to shave or not to participate in ippt, one say won't check but another say like school liddat need to be short and neat. Anyone has a definite answer??"
i think u need to make yourself clear here on what do u mean by shave.  if your beard is only abit should be perfectly fine. Unless they are those until which your entire chin cannot be seen.
Thanks for the info! Have been leaving my beard to grow so definitely must shave it all off T.T
Thanks for the info! Have been leaving my beard to grow so definitely must shave it all off T.T The person who can provide you with a definite answer is the person who will catch you or will not catch you. Doubt it will be anybody here.
"From what I see, they won't huan lor such thing de. Never see beard but got see people keeping their hair long (totally cover ears), also no one care.  Just be neat and tidy should be can liao. Of course, also depends on which camp you go to and the in-charge for that day. Cos I think, technically, they can enforce de.  Maju camp like more strict, even the normal instructors there also more strict, for no reason.  Bedok camp, more relaxed. Most instructors, I see their focus is on finishing training as fast as possible, so they can pang kang earlier.  Even if they enforce, at most just talk to you niah. Won't so bo liao charge or mark you one.  ORD liao right? Got pink IC why so scared?"
Anyone knows SAFRA Punggol pushup is machine or hand counted? I did at maju fcc a few weeks back pass with running and situp but the pushup machine make me damn jialatjialat. Needed one more pushup to pass. Taking my partial retake at lunggol safra.
tried the elis push up Machine.  guess the trick is first few counts dun go too low and buttocks down. subsequently go slightly lower and buttocks up. need to test a few more times to confirm theory
"hi all,  which is your preferred FCC for taking IPPT, or even Safra(not familiar)?  all FCC uses machine for push up now?"
"Hi guys, if I am 38 this year and I cleared IPPT, can I just ignore all the IPPT SMSes from mindef next year since I will MR when I hit 40? I'll be damned if I have to go through another FFI IPPT next year.  Thanks in advance."
MR loh!
"Hi, any tips on the push-up machine for ippt. it screwed the counting big time"
Do bench press in the gym bruh. Confirm minimally hit 60
"Do the first rep slowly without going too low. The moment it's registered, you can amp up the reps."
"Hello, has anyone tried those IPT in the Park kind of sessions before? I booked an upcoming one at Bishan Park and was wondering if there is a place for us to put our belongings."
Last time I used to take IPT In The Park at Jurong Central Park regularly and they will tend to have their meeting point at a shelter and you can put your belongings there as there will have one person there (medic etc) looking after those belongings in the shelter.
"normally, the machine says no count . i straight away stop my session."
Thanks bro
one person one attempt
"up to 2 attempts. for push-up if you feel that machine is not counting even tho you think u are doing standard push-up, you can flag out to the FI and they will do manual count and post-review video of your form and posture afterwards to see if any is considered no count. that will form your final push-up score."
i realise buttock mus lift higher to prevent body not straight error
2 attempt for both sit up and push up. But no one in the right mind will take 2nd attempt
"Hi bros, if I did not pass my ippt within my ippt window and I have to go for 15 ipt sessions.  My qns is if I pass my ipt ippt within the 15 ipt sessions,  Do I still need to complete all 15 of them?  Can I still get the incentive reward?  Thank you."
"a little correction to your post- u can attempt ""non-ICT IPPT"" anytime during your window (unless if you are already under RT). this is because ""IPT-IPPT"" only applies to the first and last session of IPT, which is 1st and 15th in your case (by right is 1st and 20th session). so during your IPPT, if u met the requirements for ""Pass with incentives"", u will be given the award accordingly based on pass w incentives, silver or gold. after your passing of IPPT, u no longer need to complete any remaining IPT sessions."
"Hi there, so is there anywhere we can put our belongings?"
there isnt any lockers there. but there will be trainers there looking over our belongings.
"hi guys, any idea if they are still giving colour tags for ipt in bedok fcc?  yellow, blue, red, green, orange still applies?"
yes.. this applies to all FCCs too
thanks  hopefully still got football to play
any idea whats the distance of the 2 yellow lines for pushup
"If I still fail my ippt when my window closed, I understand that I need to go for RT. May I ask if I pass my ippt on the 8th session of RT, do I still need to go for future sessions? This is my first window gg. Also, it is true that saf pays you when you go for rt on weekends based on your rank right? Pass RT IPPT also get incentive correct? Thanks alot kakis!!!"
"Yes pays you half day rank pay for every session you attended Yes only if you pass with incentive is $200, pass itself no money"
"All IPTs, RTs and IPPT have 1/2 service pay. Rates are the same on both weekdays and weekends. Do note that only for IPPT, only a maximum of 3 IPPT sessions will be entitled to the 1/2 day service pay. This count includes any IPT-IPPT, RT-IPPT and non-ICT IPPT"
Any idea what each tag represent?

Am I still required to take IPPT (my window opened last month) as my MR takes effect from 1st April 2019? Will I still be charged if I do not attend any IPPT session from now till my MR date? Thanks.
"funky_banana wrote: hi guys, any idea if they are still giving colour tags for ipt in bedok fcc?  yellow, blue, red, green, orange still applies? Yellow = Strength and conditioning (Upper body and core mostly, for pushups and sit-ups) Blue = ""Fitness Challenge"" (Circuit training with kettle bells, weighted... bars? and stuff) (IMO, a more intensive version of yellow) Red = Cardio (aerobic fitness, for running; trainers usually will include a bit of other exercises to improve push-ups and sit-ups, just to mix things up) Green = Weight Management Programme for obese personnel. Orange = Sports.  There's a purple tag as well, so I hear, that does evening classes on weekdays like K-Pop aerobics (?) and stuff. I've never done those so if anyone could elaborate on these for a fuller picture, it would be appreciated."
replies made to your post in another thread
"Purple tag are only available for the 1800 hrs session on every Tue and Thurs, the 4 types of Specialise Training are Piloxing, Fight Do (MMA), Kickboxing and KPOPX. It will be rotated every month among the 4 FCC."
The distance between the 2 Push Up lines are about 75cm apart
"Sry if this was asked bef. If i do all 10 ipt session and then the 10th one which is ippt, if i failed tat do i need go for rt?  Sent from Your Nightmare using GAGT"
No need RT for the following window regardless of the last IPT-IPPT. IPT package = 10 x sessions with the 1st and last session as IPT-IPPT.

Does clearing my ippt during ICT clear my RT window?  Edit: ok re-read the thread and found out that clearing during ICT clears your RT window
Are the push up machines very strict? Any tips to share and anyone tried it at Bedok? Thanks in advance!
"as long as proper form, no issue  got pti watching also"
hands must stay within yellow lines
Good thread read
"Both lines are 75 cm apart. Elbow at least 90 degrees bend with the back straight and arms fully extended to be considered a good push up.  The board (where you place your hands) will vibrate and the blue light (sensor at the front of the display panel) will blink if your push up meet the standard.  The machine will prompt you (when PU is not to the standard) by telling you either 'keep your back straight', 'chest go lower' or 'straighten your arms', so listen to the cue from the machine as why your PU is not valid/ counted/  Try to request for the 'trial tag' to try out the machine prior to your test in order to have a better understanding on how the machine works."
wow thanks spiderman33
Thanks for the info! Greatly appreciated!
Must I achieve gold in 1st three attempts to count towards the $500 incentive ?
"no. as long as on any ippt you get gold, u will get that incentive. even if this is your 4th attempt in ippt.  only the first 3 ippt will be paid with the 1/2 service pay allowance."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...pt-top-scorers
"You will be paid the incremental difference; ie, 1st attempt you attained Incentive award ($200) and the 2nd attempt you attained Silver, you will be paid the incremental difference of $100 (from Silver to Gold will be $200). Max pay out per year will be $500."

"Rt 19th session is rt-ippt right? I went today, qeued for ippt but the instructor say is training and after I attended and gotten the slip, it printed 17th session but I booked 2 days ago on ns portal is the 19th session. How ar?"

You won't be sent to DB if you did not get a formal written warning which said that your nect default will result in detention. They will usually hand out this 'special' warning first. If you previous default was just a fine then you're still OK. But if you go kena charge this time plus DB warning then next time better not default.
Nope. 2.4km is a must-do.
"if i didn’t go for RT but have medical report recommendation for downgrade, would i still be charge for IPPT/RT default cause i don’t have any excuse letter during the period before the report came out"
" technically you should have cover for the duration of your window; you should have gotten some black and white or proof while you are undergoing review by your doctors. that one is your fault already.  but what is done is done, just tell your unit asap about your condition, who will most likely arrange a medical review for you.  they will most likely be kind enough to excuse you, but please discuss with your unit."
" maybe you have 2 cancellations prior to that?  please check....  if there is really an error , try to call up the fitness centre during office hours, or call your unit"
Jurong safra is manual or machine? Last year take is manual keep getting no count till i very du lan

As long as you doing after your latest birthday it will be considered for that exact window. No such thing as 2 month rule. Do your IPPT and keep the results slip in case of any discrepancies that may arise. Take a picture also the ink on the result slip will fade.
Is the weekend morning IPPT slot not for RT personnel? I can’t seems to book the morning 7.30am slot. (Or am I slow?) lol. Always see the 4.30pm slot no matter how early I book. I’m in RT phase now

"Hi guys,  Will you get paid if you attend a non-ICT IPPT at one of the FCC but purposely fail?  Should still get paid for the ~1.5 hours right?"
"all non-ICT IPPT, IPT, RT, IPT-IPPT and RT-IPPT will be given 1/2 day service pay. do note that attendance of IPPT of any kind (non-ICT or IPT), the pay will only be given for 3 of such sessions only."
"your understanding is correct. if u are not able to have any ICT, u can consider doing a non-ICT IPPT. as long u satisfy Level 2 target, u are cleared from your window."

"if no pass ffi, will system still allow to take?"
NSmen aged 35 will be required to take FFI to determine if you are still suitable for IPPT.  i believe that my above statement is self-explanatory .

"I am a bit confused.  I've all along been doing 20 sessions of RT every cycle.  But I've been urged to now do 10 sessions of IPT by my friends.  As first as I can tell, IPT is now extremely similar to RT, except that it is 10 sessions and is now paid.  Can anyone share what are the cons, downsides and disadvantages of choosing IPT over RT?  Thanks in advance!"
"So by going 10 IPT, you will earn lesser money compare to 20 RT."
"10 ipt can be done in a month, like my case, I left 1 month 2 weeks to clear 20 rts, I every week good boy go 3x,just nice on the day before my birthday, I cleared 20 rts. And straight away the day after my birthday, I book ipt and get it done within a month, so free till next 3rd oct2019"

"Hi all. My RT window closes in 2 weeks’ time. Due to work commitments and injury (got a 3 months excuse from IPPT/IPT/RT during my ICT in June), I have only completed 1 RT session. I have 2 RT sessions for the next 2 weekends before my window closes.  My question is has anyone successfully requested from PTI to let you take IPPT before the 8th session of RT?"
Perhaps you may want to consider booking an IPPT on your own.
"Sure that would be ideal, if not for the fact that the system does not allow me to do so. I defaulted last window."
Hi checking if let say if ytd i last min book for tdy's ipt and didnt received any sms. Still able to attend? Thanks  Sent from Your Nightmare using GAGT
yes.. as long as u managed to make a booking. do save a screenshot of your booking to show your booking at the guardroom.
Ok thanks  Sent from Your Nightmare using GAGT
how was your ippt session
"Hi all, If i missed the booked 8am IPT at Maju on a sunday morning, can i attend the 4pm session without booking it?"
Anyone have any info if the IPT training lessons is still on? I heard from my friend that all IPT IPPT RT training from now till 07-NOV-2018 will be cancelled due to that Bionix incident. He attended IPT training at Bedok camp this morning and was told so. Just to clarify.
"Just finish the IPT session at Punggol park. IPT is still on, attendance is counted, just that training is cancelled. They just do some warm up, then the trainer will give a 15 mins fitness talk."
Obviously NO lol
Why you never ask your friend?
Buey sai gatecrash one
My NS officer sent us a message that until 7 Nov all IPPT will be cancelled and the FCCs will send a message or call those affected. For those who can't clear their IPPT on time due to this they will be given extension to clear their IPPT.  For IPT/RT it is still on.
"Ok, like this means for IPT and RT that falls on or before 07-NOV-2018, still have to book in clock attendance. Do warm up, listen to some fitness talk then can book out.  If IPPT falls on or before 07-NOV-2018, then have to re-book IPPT lesson."
"Can, they will need to clear with the oic encik first. Mine allowed me to take IPPT on my 2nd RT session, heng i passed. hahaha did mine at bedok FCC"
"If let's say I book a non-ICT IPPT session at one of the FCC, but didn't turn up for it. Will there be any penalty?"
"Nope , none.  Sent from little piano world using GAGT"
"Guys how to check my ICT attendance?   This image has been resized.Click to view original image   Nth leh..  I search NS booklet, logged in, this is what it says.  I googled, ppl say got left tab beside ur name to let u check ur ICT attendance?  I think i'm on my tenth year liao. But havent receive any MR letter, so wanna check."
"Hi all If my RT-ippt session was cancelled yesterday due to the safety timeout, will ns portal update the rt-ippt session as cancelled or there will be no update?"
This ELISS 3.0 really no joke. Luckily I managed to borderline clear...
"Is it correct to say that if I passed the IPPT on my 8th ICT, that means just attempted once IPPT during the 9th and no need RT for the 10th ICT, provided unit recalled me every year and I have MRed during the 10th before my windows close?"
"u attempt and assuming pass in year 9 no issue going into last ict i.e. year 10 year 10 technically u still have to do your last ict and accompanying obligations i.e. ippt before you officially attain MR status effective 1 april the following year.  when's your hatchday effective MR is 1 April so even if your unit's last ict is during this FY 2018, this will leave you a few months before officially start fy 2019 for e.g."
"push up is machine count besides tt, u mean they intro more machine-tracking element"
I'm not exactly sure but there are certain times when my pushups or situps are not counted at all. The machine just remains silent or gives a beep.
"MR status is effective the following 1 Apr after your 10th ICT. If you birthday falls before 1 Apr, there is a chance the IPPT window that coincides with your 10th ICT closes before you officially MR, hence resulting in a defaulter case because you attended 0 RT session.  Even if from the time your window closes till you receiving the Charge letter, you had MR'ed in between i'm not sure if SAF will consider it a valid reason and let you off.  It's a bit risky."
Quick question.  I defaulted last window. So current window I've cleared all 20 RT sessions with 2x ippt attempted.  My window closes June 2019.  Does this mean I've completed my obligations for this period? When my window opens next year I can take 10x IPT and be done?
"yr default window in question is it for June 2017 to June 2018? assuming you clear your stuaff via the package u have mention, it only mean u clear what u ortang for 2017/2018 what abt June 2018 to June 2019? u have done any ippt/RT/IPT?"
This image has been resized.Click to view original image Looks like this now.. So I wait till next yr liao?
simply the answer is yes
Ok. So if I book 10x IPT for now? I clear the 2018/1019 requirements?
what are u even talking about? U can only book IPT after 29 Jun 2019.  u have already cleared 2018/2019.
Oh.. Okay. I'm able to book IPT thru the NS portal. So I don't have to go for that?
Wait next window lol
"as per your screenshot indicated, ""your next IPPT window will open on 29 June 2019"". conditions to clear a IPPT window - 1) pass IPPT; 2) satisfy your PPT (depending on the level you are at); 3) completed IPT; 4) completed RT. for yours is condition (4). Nevertheless, you are still welcomed and it is OPTIONAL to go for any IPT upon your RT completion. You can still receive 1/2 service pay allownace for the IPT you attended and to continue exercise. As to answer your question directly, you do not need to go for anymore IPT."
"for weekday ippt, do we need to book in by 5pm? need to work. anyone tried to book in around 615pm?"
"same question here.  I booked mine as RT-IPPT (and strangely, I have 19 sessions instead of 20 - not sure why)"
"If you attempted IPPT in last window , then it'll be 20 - 1 so 19. Sent from little piano world using GAGT"
thanks! I booked for my RT (which is supposed to be IPPT) at 6PM just now. is there a need to arrive like at 5PM? I've seen people take IPPT really early
"see the link below on all the schedule. https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...cs/ippt-ipt-rt  5pm is only for IPPT. Whereas for IPT and RT, is either 6pm or 7pm (evening slots).  Whichever session u booked, the counter only opens for that particular session 15mins before the session time."
Raining RT still on anot? Go there mark attendance sit there?
Got gym and shelter means rain still can do lol
still can have indoor activities. Mindef will send u an SMS should the session be cancelled.
I'm at 13/17 now  So 14th is RT-IPPT. And 17th is RT-IPPT.  Correct ma? Haha
should be correct.
"Just did my 8th IPPT-RT today (Tuesday) but failed.  Say i book another RT on Thursday, can i request to retake IPPT again?  Reason is because my window for this year closes this Friday, and I defaulted last year.  Need some insight on this, thanks guys."
"No. Its only on 8th and 14th session. So , likely RT defaulter since can't complete all sessions of RT. Sent from little piano world using GAGT"
"Could i possibly ask them to give me another shot? Also, are the penalties for defaulting IPPT and RT the same?"
"As extracted from https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...idelines-rt/RT ""Tip: If you would like to take your RT or IPPT before the scheduled IPPT session, e.g. your 8th session, please approach the Officer-in-Charge at the Fitness Conditioning Centre (FCC) during your RT for advice."" However, u can try by asking the in-pro counter during your RT on the day of your session. But you will need to be attending the session that has IPPT being conducted."

Within 4 working days. Sent from little piano world using GAGT

"your unit will inform u that u failed to clear your window, and your next RT shall consist of how many sessions. Only if you are a repeated offender, you may be called to report to camp."
any idea on this? I've checked the website. they say IPPT open from 5PM to 9PM but.. lol
That's puzzling. What about RT defaulter charge?  Sent from little piano world using GAGT
how is it puzzling? 1st time could be warning. 2nd time fine 3rd or more fine or DB

"Hi, i tried 3 ippt attempts and failed all.  For the rt ippt retest, is it on the 5th rt or the 8th rt since i only need to complete 17 rt instead of 20 rt?"

"Hi, I am about to take my IPPT at Safra Jurong. Just checking if pushup and sit up stations are recorded using machines or still manually count?"
"Anyone knows Aqua Jogging, is normally conducted on which day, which timing and which venues?"
"For 1st session of IPT(IPT-IPPT), if we score 0 for all stations will the session be counted?"
Got aqua jogging ah? Thought only in bmt haha.
"yes. basically is the attendance, and u need to complete all the stations."
"What will happen if first time for the year, never fulfil all 20 RT and fail ah for the calendar year? Summon to CMPB, and $50 fine??"
"Questions to ask regarding attire, as the guideline is not really comprehensive  1) If I wear short compression tights (above knee), must I wear another running pants to cover my groin, due to female instructors present. Or just wear a long singlet which is enough to cover your groin by tugging out?  2) Is wearing calf sleeves allow during test?  Intending to take IPPT at Bedok Camp. And I intend to only bring minimum items (11B, phone, water bottle), as after the test, need to ""Charlie-Mike"" 10km home-run"
"Thurs 1230, Khatib Camp. Only for IPT. Remember to bring along your PT kit as well as there is some land training before the aqua jogging part. And of course your swimming trunks."
Hi guys.  have anyone done IPT/RT at Punggol Park?  what are the activities been conducted at this locations?  and if there is any place for us to wash up after the IPT/RT?  Thanks in advance
"My last reservist is this year.  If i fail my ippt this year, do i need to go rt next year? My birthday is in Jan.  Any experts can advise"
Yes You need to take 19 sessions of RT
"so the first IPT session is IPT-IPPT, report time stated is 730pm at the online booking  but for normal IPPT booking report is 7pm.  Should i report at 7pm or 730pm?"
Hi all  i kena 20 rt cause i failed.  Can i keep taking IPPT for my RT sessions until i pass? or only 8th 14th 20th?  Thanks
"Hi guys, does my failed IPPT on reservice counts as one/the first IPT session?  Do i have to all 10 IPT sessions or do i skip the first and only need to go 9?"
"The answer is NO. First IPT session derives from the attendance from IPT only. However, your RT-IPPT is considered as 1 out of the 3 IPPT in which 1/2-day service pay is payable to you. Meaning that this service pay is given for the first 3 IPPTs of any kind (IPT-IPPT, RT-IPPT, non-ICT IPPT, and ICT-IPPT). For your 2nd question.. your IPT will be 10 sessions... Only to say if you take no further actions to your IPPT window after this ICT-IPPT, your next window shall be under RT and it will be 20-1 = 19 sessions."
"Once u are in RT, u can only take IPPT on the 8th, 14th and 20th, or ICT-IPPT. Any non-ICT IPPT during RT window will not be allowed. Therefore, if you want the flexibility, make sure you are not under RT... only then u can go for many IPPTs as you like."
follow your IPT schedule.
"first time, can be fine or verbal warning.  and of course, dont repeat your npn-compliance again for the next window and expect the say form of punishment."
"My RT window is closing on 19 Jan 2019, and I have completed 16/19 RT sessions, with 3 sessions planned on this Sat, Next Thurs, and Next Sat.  Question: I remembered RT to be 20 sessions, with the 8th, 14th, & 20th session being RT-IPPT. How come now becomes 19 RT sessions?  Do I need to book a non-ICT-IPPT after my 19 RT sessions before my window closes?"
Thank you for the clarification! Does that means its 'better' / more worth it to do RT since i get one lesser session from it making it 19sessions instead of 2xIPT of 10+10=20sessions.
It still work out to be 20 sessions in 2 years (10 ipt sessions per year or do nothing for current window and get charge followed by 20 RT sessions). RT at FCC only but IPT have more venues to choose from.
Last window you taken 1 x IPPT but failed so current window is 20 - D (1) = 19 RT only. No need to book for Non ICT after your 19 sessions.
Non ICT IPPT @ 1700 hrs (5pm) & RT/ IPT IPPT@ 1800 hrs (6pm) or 1900 hrs (7pm) on weekdays (Tue to Thurs).  Sat @ 1630 hrs (430pm) or 1730hrs (530pm) for RT/ IPt IPPT. No slot at 730pm!
HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training). Public toilet to wash up.
1) no need additional shorts to cover your tights (tights must be above knee level) 2) Yes.
Test starts at 5pm and need to report 15 mins earlier!
Manual counting for all test conducted at SAFRAs at this point of time.
"Just went for my last lesson (17th) and it's a training session  Thought it was an RT-IPPT. Sian haha So it's ONLY the 8, 14, 20.  My 17th isn't the 20th I see now. Lol"
"YES. And that is why that is an indication of whether will there be a ""TEST"" on the available session! And you are supposed to select the timing that has the test! Particularly it is being indicated during the selection of your session so I do not see how confusing can that be. unless u can tell me that IPT-IPPT has the same time slot as non-ICT IPPT. Let's be clear on this."
IPT IPPT for MHA (SPF & SCDF) personnel only will be the same time slot as the Non ICT IPPT. Thanks for all the info provided for the NSmen
"If i took my IPPT on ICT and failed and did not try to pass it for this year nor attempt to do another IPPT outside of ICT, do i get charged? Or do they automatically enroll me into RT the following year?"
"As long u attempted 1 IPPT/ICT-IPPT in the whole work cycle, u will not be charged."
Does anyone know if it is possible for me to book IPPT if I’ve only completed 1/20 RT sessions? I have been training for IPPT on my own time hoping that I could book the IPPT test without having to go for 7 RTs before taking IPPT on the 8th..
"Anyone know if during your ippt window, your 1st attempt ippt got silver, then you go for 2nd attempt fail. Will the system take into account the last attempted result(fail) or the best attempted result(silver)?"
ehhhhhhhh? Seriously?
Erm...........
wah lao bro  of coz is take the silver one la
You sure you want to call him a bro?
the best result during the same window.....  perhaps u should read through the entire IPPT-related info in the NS portal first. It has more information than you actually realize.
"No.. as long as u are under RT window.. u can only take IPPT on your RT-IPPT or on ICT-IPPT.  that is the downside of RT.  if u want the flexibility to book IPPT anytime for your next following applicable window, do clear your window by either passing IPPT or clearing IPT.  many people are saying that IPT and RT is the same in the sense that u still need to complete 20 sessions over 2 years.. but failed to mention about the flexibility in the program. And this also consist of RT attendance which is compulsory, whereas IPT is not."
"i book the AMK ipt , Can't see the meeting point is near McDonalds.  https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...ng-mo-kio-park"
"in order to avoid confusion.. perhaps u should mention the correct name which is Bishan Park, not AMK.. if u do not know the meeting point, just wait at Macdonals and look towards the park. When the timing of the session starts, just look facing the park. u should be seeing the flag of IPT"
I just recently injured my ankle during football and I have an IPPT scheduled on 23 Jan. How do I inform them that I can do my IPPT on that day?
try to call ns hotline ask?
Hey I applied for a deferment because I am studying abroad now and it is going to end on the 30th of June. Does anyone have any idea when it is possible for me to be enlisted? Also when does the the enlistment date milestone in NS portal activate?
Have you gone through medical checkup?
"is it possible to take RT-IPPT before the 8th session, ie 6th or 7th? because due to work and the 1 day compulsory rest between RT, was also my fault for procrastinating. I don't have time to complete 8 sessions before my window close."
No  But I think someone mentioned here like possible. But can't rmb if same situation
"Yes, I was able to chill for the past one year due to doing this from 2 years ago. Will repeat the same strategy this year."
Yeah I have already completed the medical checkup. I did it in July 2018.
I am already in RT and during my recent Ict ippt I still failed. Will that be counted as one session to my RT?
Nope..  10char
"ok. just take note that your unit may contact u or charge u for being a defaulter, with the possibility of no RT sessions for u in the next window as u would have already 20-20 RT"
"No. Once u are in RT, u can either take IPPT on ICT-IPPT or RT-IPPT. And the good thing about ICT-IPPT is only if u pass, then u are cleared.  Otherwise, stick back to your 20-D RT sessions"
Hi i took IPPT this morning and achieved a pass (first time in this window) Can i check how many times i am allowed to repeat IPPT to try to get silver and eligible for the top up? I remembered last time it was up to 3 tries.
First 3 is paid iirc
"only first 3 IPPT of any kind (non-ICT IPPT, IPT-IPPT, RT-IPPT inclusive) will have 1/2-day service pay.  u can participate in more than 3 IPPTs, and should u obtain the higher award, u will be paid the difference in that amount."
"From the McDonalds's, cross the bridge, and then turn left. The IPT session begins at the first shelter you come across. It's roughly a 2-minute walk from the McDonald's."
"haha no la, never get charged. Let me go find the quote.  Edit: found it.  Quote: In the event that D is more than 20, it will be capped at 20. You will not have to take RT but must attempt at least 1 IPPT (i.e. Non-ICT IPPT or ICT IPPT) in your IPPT Window. Please take note of this."
So you mean whack 20ippt+1 ippt? Clear Liao? For 2 years
"Yes, but 10 IPT + 10 IPT is more appropriate for most people. You also get more paid sessions than 20 IPPT + 1 IPPT.  In fact I don't think anyone else will bother. It's only for people like me, my job is those kind when busy, is busy until 7 day workweek, but when free, is really do nothing to do kind.  I just wanted to dispell the misconception that you will become a defaulter for doing 20 IPPT because you cannot do RT in the following year."
I see. Thanks bro
"Hi guys, if i went to do IPPT but i fallout during the 2.4KM, does it count as an attempt? Or do i need to walk finish the 2.4KM."
"Can I ask, are our unit commanders allowed to informally ask us to do something (like stay-in) if we did not clear our IPPT? For my case they kept asking us to stay in, even asking us to stay in on the nights we are off duty/on dismount (shift system, next day standby) and weekends (essentially, stay in camp everyday). However, I don't see how just staying in would help us improve our IPPT score."
u already put it - informally  never pass IPPT = confinement......quite normal at least during my time as a trainee
"Hey guys, can I ask how’s the ict Ippt in Changi Airbase like? Report 7.45am outside pass office? Heard there is a bus? If I wear no 4 in, can I change my attire at the ippt venue? Sorry noob here, pls help!"
Count as attempt...doesn't matter u pass or fail...they just need to record ur attendance to prove effort u attend ippt
"I would like to ask about IPT. Is it confirm that I only need to attend 10 sessions of IPT and it would be considered clear regardless of my first and last ippt score?  Because I am lacking the ability to do many pushups and I forsee I am gonna get 40+ points. if my first session and last session Ippt (a day before my birthday) score are 40+, does it mean it's cleared?  Or it depends on the Personal Performance Target (PPT) Level and it will be considered as I failed, hence required to RT..."
yes.. IPT is basically about clocking attendance
Alright great! IPPT is such a burden haha
"There's a safety timeout in place. There's no physical exercises allowed in IPT or RT. Go there, clock attendance then can leave. IPPT seems to be cancelled till further notice"
 really bro? when u go ? what time your session & what time u leave?
"Went Maju yesterday, 7pm session. In pro and out pro completed in about 25min."
So did the instructor said the safety timeout will be until when?
 bro this one not up to those instructor to say leh is CDF say
wah swee do what in the 25min?  I think they cancel all IPPT. those window closing one cham..
"Those who can't complete IPPT requirement in time will be granted extension, depending on individual's circumstances. That was according to my reservist officer who forwarded the NSAD message to us during last November's safety timeout. Dunno will my IPT-IPPT next Thursday will be affected or not......"
"up to CDF to decide lor, they say their guess is until CNY over. need to wait until confirmation  justme wrote: wah swee do what in the 25min?  I think they cancel all IPPT. those window closing one cham.. 25min for in pro, chit chat, then out pro"
Cleared rt.  Need wait after my bday in Feb then can start booking IPT?  Coz online seems like can book le
U can book in advance.. but the session has to be in your new window.
"I see, no wonder. Thanks"
"Just come back from Punggol park ipt.  No attendance clock , every thing is canceled till after cny"
Got SMS that RT is cancelled for tomorrow. Wah until when ah we got no news one
I book zunzun 8 session till 19feb which end my window..now got message say RT cancel..how??can ask for extension??anyone else kena cancel recently?

Looks like it..but no official date when can start back..i book already if cancel confirm tio charge lei

I also received thev sms that RT/IPT/IPPT is cancelled but it didn't stated until when and I have a IPT and a IPT-IPPT next week..
By right they will give extension for us to complete it under such circumstances.
got the sms too but checked ns.sg the booking for next week is still active. so is how leh.
"Man I was supposed to take my 14th session RT-ippt session (which I can pass) on Thursday I called in to bedok FCC and they suggested I go down to do ""light stretching"" RT lol   My window closes right after CNY so it looks like I'm gonna get charged again if they don't open up for ippt next week..."

I tried the NS live chat..they say they will sent an email about it..since i have 8 more rt session impossible to settle before 19 feb which is when my window close..all my rt session before cny were cancelled lol
Any idea how to get my unit contact number??the new NS portal doesnt have My Unit section anymore
"Hi guys, want ask if I complete 10 ipt sessions in my current open window, means fulfiled the criteria right ? Cos i wanna attend all ASAP thanks everyone"
Yes  10 char.....
No wonder cos my push up fail liao no point running
At least run one round then fall out..
I think RT is still on. Only IPPT is cancelled. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Checked my booking only the RT-IPPT scheduled next week got automatically cancelled i.e. disappear from booking. Those RT booking are still there.
I think their system only reflects that IPPT is cancelled. For my case my IPT-IPPT next week is cancelled and my IPT booking tomorrow is still there and I still received the reminder sms just now. I believe that IPT and RT is also cancelled just that their system only reflected that IPPT is cancelled. But when I amended my IPT sessions I have noticed that all the dates before CNY are unavailable for booking.
I have RT tmr also. Noticed the same as well. This while week and next week is blocked out. So means it's likely cancelled? Don't want to self pwn. Hahaha.
Yup if it is not cancelled then we should be able to book other days before 3 Feb (as 4 Feb to 10 Feb FCCs are closed by default due to cny holidays.
So the coming week got RT or not? They say cancelled but never say until when so stupid am I supposed to guess for them
"From what I observed on ns.sg booking, it seems like there will be no IPPT/IPT/RT until after CNY.  All the dates until 10 Feb are unavailable from ns.sg booking."
is there a way to extend eligibility for ippt after MR for MEN? not commander.

"Try to contact your unit S8 or DYS8, he should be able to help you to extend your window as for this case it is not your fault for being unable to complete your RT before your window close."
By right you should have received their sms stating that all IPPT/IPT/RT have been cancelled last Friday night.
Any idea how i can get my units number?or could i get the number from calling CMPB hotline?
You can call the NS hotline to enquire them about your unit contact number.  Or you can address your concern to the NS hotline CSO and they will refer it to your unit and your unit S8/DYS8 will contact you after the NS hotline CSO have forwarded your case to them.
"1. Yes. 2. I don't think any IHL is exempt from RT at all. Am not 100% sure on this, can some other NSKB veterans please confirm? 3. Yes."
the post that u replied was from year 2013. N i think IHL are excused from IPPT. That NSmen can check via NS Portal if they are required to complete the window.
"Sry i got a noob qns, can't seem to find the ans online: if i failed my ippt and have been training intensely on my own but my window is over, can i directly book and pass the ippt next window instead of going through all the RTs? Do i have really have to go through all the RTs?  P.S i am also affected by the ippt shutdown and my window will end before i am ready to book and attempt"
"Oops! I must have not been looking at the latest posts when I was replying... thanks for the clarification, regardless."
"when there are cases of shutdowns, the time given to clear your window will be extended accordingly. do call your unit for clarifications. if unit were to insist u perform RT, sad to say that u can only do RT-IPPT on your 8th session"
"You cannot book IPPT directly in your current window if you failed IPPT in the last window. You will need to attend RT in which sessions 8,14 &18 are RT-IPPTs. So minimally you will need to complete 7 sessions of RT before you can take your first IPPT. If you pass you will not be required to complete the remaining RT sessions. The only exception is ICT-IPPT. So if you have an ICT in your current window, you can take the IPPT conducted there and be relieved of your RT obligations if you pass. The best course of action now would be to call your unit (through NS hotline) to extend your previous window so you can still book your IPPT. Sent from OnePlus ONEPLUS A3003 using GAGT"
"Current Window: IPPT Status: Not Passed You can opt to complete IPT Program to meet your IPPT requirements by 22 May 2019.  Hi, if i fail ippt i have to complete 20 rt sessions before the stated date?"

Anyone knows if can drive in to Khatib Camp for RT? Anything to take note? Heading there for my 1st RT 😨
Heading over directly from work. Gotta drive if not I’ll be late. Hahaha thanks.
This is re: IPT  Anyone know if 10th session die die need to be IPPT? Can i do the 10th session as IPT in the park? Will still be counted?  By right only need 1 attempt for IPPT right per window

"1st n 10th needs to be IPT-IPPT. if failing to make the 10th session an IPPT, u will be deemed not cleared your window and considered as ""IPPT Failure"". However, if never attempt 1 IPPT session, u will be charged as ""IPPT Defaulter"". See - https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...efaulting-ippt"
Hi all If I book rt but forget to come for just 1 day only. Is it ok. you miss 1 day. or unable to turn out due to some personal issue u had.
"You will not be faulted for missing this particular session that you booked, however, you still must ensure that you complete all the required sessions during your window."
"hmm, just received an SMS that my IPPT at Khatib FCC next Wednesday is cancelled. Anyone knows why? The whole of Feb and March 2019 is grey, no slots available"
Try book at offer fcc? Or call the hotline
"I also cant book IPT-IPPT (10th session) at Khatib FCC for April, not sure why. Anyway, I have booked IPT-IPPT at Kranji FCC, just go there go through motion and complete"
"Had checked with the Khatib trainers, they mentioned for this period all ippt sessions at Khatib will be cancelled until further notice. Reason being there is ongoing safety review for Khatib FCC.  Only normal training for ipt and rt will continue. If you need to take ippt, need to book through other FCCs.  Sent from LGE LG-H860 using GAGT"

I signed up for IPPT at Khatib but also told that cancelled until further notice.... Sian now must go and attend another IPPT
"Damn I thought because I too slow to book at Khatib, all full. End up booking Maju Camp.. never been there before. Where do I go to report at the venue?"
"Hi, just checking if i take ippt during year 0 will I get $$? Cause my s8 said will have during ord talk but some others claim only year 1 onwards"
Go maju camp ask guardhouse they direct u or just follow those ppl in PT kit
"For Year 0 u will still get incentives accordingly. However is not mandatory for you to fulfill your IPPT window requirement.  Only from Year 1 onwards, you will need to satisfy the window."
eh how come all the RT suddenly all no IPPT one?
is it u tried booking at Khartib FCC?
"For 1st ipt, can we book tpy safra for the ipt ipt?"
"hi all. last year i took my ippt at khatib fcc.  the 2.4 quite jialat because of the sun and big wind. it is run around stadium track 6 rounds that kind. my running alr not v good but heng i passed.  this year i want try kranji fcc. the ippt route is it easier?? like maybe under shelter, etc??? quite concerned for running. for static stations i think every camp also use machine alr so pretty much the same"
Kranji thou under shelter. Buy very dusty and slippery if wet.
how come dusty? what area is that
The carpark where they park the big vehicles haha
"ahh, icic. thanks!"
How do we know if RT is cancelled due to raining? Will they send SMS?
any official cancellation will be by sms
"i think you will still get charged leh, and next cycle must go for RT again  Call NS Hotline and ask if can have extension to attend last session?"
How long are IPT sessions nowadays?  For eg. Maju Camp  Thanks
Total time from in-pro till out-pro: 45-50mins.
anyone booked more than 10 IPT before? heard from someone can do more than ten.
It happened to me before..just inpro for ict and meet with ur officer or clerk..Tell them the situation..and u will be charge 4days after inpro..dunno why but being charge in camp during ict have been much cheaper..based on my 3 times experience hahaha
After the time out training+waiting time 45 min...training now is like almost 30 min
"same thing. if u failed to understand the meaning of ""in-pro"" and ""out-pro""."
"yes u can still book more than 10 IPTs, as they are voluntary sessions. However, more than 10 sessions will not have any 1/2 day service pay given.  and that does not excuse you from doing lesser session in the next window."
Khatib now no ippt meh? Why ah
look thru the previous threads in this page. it was mentioned by some contributors.
anyone tried pushup with his face looking at the ground instead of looking forward? would the machine count that as a fault? i have issue doing rapid reps if look forward
i did it looking at the ground. it was still counted.
great! thanks for helping! i am just doing as it forces me to work out. i stay rather nearby.
anyone knows the IPT timing for Sunday at Khatib FCC?  I can't rmb if it's 8:30am or 9:30am and the portal is down now so I can't check.
thank u. thats reassuring
"hi if i were to go ippt for year 0 and get $$, if i go for year 1 will i get $$ also?"
see previous post. https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/1...-post6490.html  apparently u had asked this Q before. Why ask again?
Sorry i meant to ask this time if I would get the incentives for both year 1 and and 0 if i went year 0. Or that if i went for year 0 i wont get for year 1 anymore?
U will still get both for Yr 0 and Yr 1 according to the incentive award system.  Only Yr 0 is not mandatory to clear IPPT window.
"939 bro, me a reglur in khatib fcc. The Malay trainer, sabrina jin bonkable"
Due to the unsafe running track..thats why no ippt done in khatib camp
Just breaking it down so they understand ba
"If i never go for FFI and attempt IPPT, what will happen?"
"if u are age 35 u are required to go for FFI. If i am not wrong the in-pro counter will question u if u have cleared FFI and can even reject your participation for IPPT. As any medical issue if you were to develop during your participation because of that, that FCC would be in trouble."
Just question? They don't have system to check and valid?
"their system should be able to check. nevertheless, they will ask you because they should be able to see from their system and in case the info is not updated.  but whatever the case is, you have to ensure that you have cleared FFI. if i were u, i would be interested to know if i pass or fail FFI because i would have to either clear the window to avoid any chargeable offences or totally be exempted from it so that i can have peace in mind.  doubt u will want to go in-pro and find out that u had actually wasted your time in making the trip down because you failed your FFI or because you have not passed FFI."
Thanks for the advice
"if u haven't done your FFI, no way you can book IPPT/RT/IPT inside NS portal then there's zero chance u can just gatecrash @ the FCC"
RT also run the track what. simi unsafe
anyone's outpro slip sessions dont tally with actual? just follow ns portal can alr?
what information on the slip not tally?
"hows the FFI like?  say I got high BP, they refer me to specialist, do I need to pay $?"
"the no. of sessions. eg. slip - RT 15; IPPT 2, so total is 17. but ns portal reflects 18. and actual training attended is 18 also."
"out-pro slip always reflect ""-1"", indicating that those are the number of sessions u already attended excluding the day of the session itself as printed."
i see. thanks. first year doing rt. thanks for guiding!
try to clear your window by doing ipt.. no complications in all aspects compared to rt.
any way to beat the IPPT machines? Any guru can advise?
maju camp usually how long ah the RT session.
all FCCs are the same.. about 30-45mins
actually i can go on days i never book right? or cannot? i know same day but different session they ok.
"same day but as long if the sessions are the direct subsequent ones is fine, for example, 6pm and 7pm sessions.  different days, or even of different FCCs.. the guardroom will not let u in as your name is not in the nominal roll."
literally beat or what  at the various stations also got cameras to catch cheating one dont smoke and try your luck
"Is khatib FCC closed? Can't book ippt there, anyone know what is going on?"
"want to know also, what happened to khatib camp?"
the running track f-up ? NDP rehearsals?
How i know..thats what the Safety and conducting officers informed when the session starts..Only Khatib Camp no Ippt only training
Only IPPT dont have..RT and IPT still have
"think the difference in Khartib FCC is that for IPPT, the run is using the inner 3 lanes, whereas IPT or RT has the choice to run on the outer lanes.  if you had paid closer attention to the track's condition, you would have notice that the condition in the inner lanes are not as good as the outer ones. In addition, maybe is the drain cover that contributes to this safety consideration."
"Thanks bros, good to know. Wanted to do ipt at khatib, thankfully only need to go elsewhere for two of the ten sessions."
"For the ippt sessions at gym, push up and sit up are manual or through the machine?"
anyone knows who to contact if IPPT results not updated and incentive not received after two months? I have a photo of my result slip as prove.
NS hotline is the only number u should be calling.
Anyone know what the difference for ippt and ipt?  I cant pass ippt
"If MR , still need to complete RT?"
Ipt just go 10 lessons then complete Liao for your window
No..........
"I'm turning 40 in Sept this year and by right I have to take and pass my IPPT before Sept or turning 40.  If I didn't, what will happen? By right once u turn 40, by law no more NS liabilities liao.  Any expert knows?"
"u turning 40 in sep 2019 your effective MR is from financial year 2020, 1 apr onwards so technically u default if things stand but then again, depends on what your unit want to do since u going to reach MR and i suppose they also don want to make life too difficult for u but holding back you from MR with any outstanding charge/admin matters bah"
"Wow so what u mean from Sept 2019 to April 2020, I'm still reliable for NS liabilities?"
"Question:  I missed my IPPT last Nov (2018) and am now asked to fulfill 20 RT sessions by 31 Oct 2019.  I have reservist next week and there is an IPPT segment. Can I take that to clear my 2018's IPPT window, or I die die need to complete my 20 RT session."
If you pass ICT-IPPT Means cleared loh If never then you can go start your RT liao
"technically yes, as it is based on the workyear.  however by normal practice, mindef won't call you guys up once you already had your MR ceremony."
the session now is about a total of 45mins including rest time.
"Anyone know if the ippt offence is reset after u clear it in 2014 during the transititon?  I was told any offence is reset but was charge a 3th offence after I went for 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 but didn’t attend 2018 and was charge a 3th time"
"Hi just to confirm, to clear an RT window, I actually just need to fulfill 1 RT IPPT on either the 8th, 14th or last session right?  Don't have to do on all? I failed the RT IPPT on the 8th session, don't think I will pass anyway in future sessions. I can just do normal training for the rest without doing more IPPTs yeah?"
"8,14,20 must take RT-IPPT the rest is normal training Last session NOT equals to RT-IPPT. E.g If your last session is 19th, it'll be a normal training."
Anyone has any idea on this or face this issue previously? Currently getting charge at $200 which i think is pretty unfair on my side since i clear it and they say they reset it.
"Heard for new push up machine, the back must be straighten while going down. Mean more disadvantageous for taller person compared to shorter person?"
tot the machine will tell u to straighten back or something if the rep is of no count?
"Yeah. That why i ask, whether it would be more disadvantageous for taller people."
just realised for SPF ippt booking and all camp slot are booked till april which is my next cycle for next yr . would there be any other location that they can slot me in to complete my ippt this yr ?
"Hi, anyone is on this trial programme called QUICKHITT session. My unit is currently on trial for this programme.  Meaning I can go outside to RT Instesd of FCC.  I completed so far 8 QuickHITT sessions. The programme required us to do 9 sessions and one ippt in fcc.  Just to check which day for Maju fcc is ippt-Rt?  Tuesday to Thursday ?"
your birthday is when? and your FY2018 IPPT not done yet?
Question:  If you decide to do 20 ipt sessions in your birthday window does that mean you do not have to do ippt the following year (20-D sessions)?
"first of all, do not get confused with the requirement. 1 . All eligible NSmen has to pass at least 1 IPPT every window. If you are not able to pass, proceed to point 2. 2. To take 10 IPT sessions which includes 2x IPPT that is called as IPT-IPPT (during 1st & 10th sessions of IPT). Whether pass or not does not matter to clear your window as long as you have fulfilled this condition. However, take note when u are booking for IPT-IPPT on the timing. If not able to comply, proceed to point 3. 3. U will be required to perform 20-D sessions of RT in the following window. What is D about I shall not go into details. Failing to comply in the following window will warrant greater disciplinary actions in the subsequent window. Basically, every window you will need to have IPPT.. simply saying. Maybe your question u had phased ""RT"" as ""IPPT"" incorrectly as you still need to do IPPT in the following year. Just that it could be RT-IPPT only. Do re-read about IPPT in the NS Portal and understand them."
better to contact your hotline to highlight your case.. rather than having the dept in finding fault with u in failing to comply.
do u know that u can actually look through it in the booking page?
"With that said, I've also heard somewhere that in your ippt (not rt) year, if you attempt ippt 20 times but not pass, you only need to attempt (don't have to pass) ippt once the following year in order to be considered clear for both years. Is that true, and would that apply if you volunteer yourself for 20 ipt sessions instead?"
"this might be true given on the fact that it is 20-D.. but this is subjected to the words from official channel and/or fellow brothers here has personally experienced it.  however, in my opinion IPT is more fruitful.. do consider the following:  - all IPT sessions will be paid (2x IPT-IPPT + 8x IPT);  - only first 3 IPPT of any kind will be paid, and this includes the IPT-IPPT. meaning that if u want to maximize the 1/2 svc pay that you are entitled, u can take 1x non-ICT IPPT in addition to the 10 IPT sessions;  - IPT sessions has more flexibility, as you can choose to attend on Sundays, weekday's noon and IPT-in-the-park for example;  - IPT takes about 45mins.. similar to IPPT;  - in the event of rain.. IPPT may be cancelled and attendance will not be counted. Whereas IPT at FCCs will continue.  so... IPT or IPPT. u decide."
"Hi, I am having my 40th birthday in April, and I presumed this current cycle is my last cycle for ippt. Then I received the letter for HSP checkup. So does this mean I still need to clear another cycle of ippt?"
So I booked an E1PEP-IPPT session and missed that. Accidentally rebooked the next session as IPPT instead of E1PEP-IPPT session and attended that. Just got a reply from contact@ns.sg that the IPPT attendence cannot be converted to an E1PEP-IPPT session attendence............. And I have to book and attend another E1PEP-IPPT to start the E1PEP program. Meaning I need to complete an extra session to finish my ippt obligation this window.  Wondering if anyone here knows who to highlight this issue to? Finding it a little ridiculous that the same 3 station ippt attendence is not interchangable between normal ippt and e1pep ippt.  Both types of ippt session are entitled to the same half day rank pay btw.  I'm also assuming that this is the case for IPT........
"Hi all  My window closes at the end of June 2019 and I am currently in my RT window. I just obtained a IPPT/RT excuse from my doctor and was advised by him to get it endorse by my unit camp MO.  I called the NS hotline to book an appointment to see my unit camp MO but was told by him that it was too late because it’s too close to the end of my window. Nevertheless he still proceeded to help me book.  My question is 1) will my unit camp MO endorse it? Hence I won’t be charged? 2) my ICT is coming up in June. If I tried to pass the ICT-IPPT, does it mean that I complete my obligations for my current RT window? And hence, won’t be charged for not completing the 20 RTs required?  Thanks all bros in advance"
"1 - MO will still have to endorse as a form of acknowledging your ""outside"" doctor's note. MO will make the decision as to how many months u shall be excused from IPPT. There is a policy that if the excused is more than a certain period of month, you will then be excused from clearing the IPPT window. However, for your case is quite vague but i believe it can be excused. 2 - ICT in june... if your MO gives the excuse of IPPT that your ICT is during this period, u are not allowed to take part in the IPPT. basically when u meet your camp's MO, do check with your S1 or S8 / NSC / Persnode about your IPPT window. Or you can request NS hotline to inform your unit to give u a callback. this should help in your queries."
"Hi all,  I have not enlist into NS yet but failed ippt in school, so will be retaking it at Toa Payoh stadium. Is Toa Payoh stadium still doing manual counting or machine counting?"
Any info when khatib fcc will be open for ippt again? The next nearest is kranji or maju and both I need 1hr to get there.  Sent from Samsung SM-G965F using GAGT
I tot this year no more ppt
one option for u.. IPPT at Safra.. no incentives though.
any SPF bros got take IPT at HTA before?
"If I cannot clear 10IPT in 1 year, will I have to take 20 RT in the next year? Or is it true for the next year, I will just need to take 10session (next year quota) + remaining of uncompleted IPT this yea?"
"Hello all,  My D = 3 because I did 3 IPPT last year and failed all 3.  So this year system says I need to clear 17 RT sessions and I can only take RT-IPPT earliest on the 8th RT session.  My question is, do I need to clear 7 RT sessions before being allowed to do the RT-IPPT or are the 3 sessions counted at the start and so I just need to clear 4 sessions and then I can do my RT-IPPT on the ""actual"" 5th session?"
"Just rmb u only can take RT-IPPT on 8th,14th,20th. So you need clear 7 RT first loh. And you only have 2 RT-IPPT (8th & 14th), the rest all RT"
"U need to clear 7 RT inorder to reach the RT-IPPT session and only if pass, u will be released from IPPT for this window only. Otherwise, 8th session is RT-IPPT followed by normal RT sessions and RT-IPPT based on the counts u are required to attend. that is why it is stated ""7th session"" and not ""7-D"" etc"
"Hi all,  I just had a MRI scan and my specialist confirmed that I have ankle sprain and need to be excused for running for 6 weeks. My IPPT window will close in May and I havent complete my IPT. I will be endorsing my specialist letter with my NS unit MO soon. Will I be liable for RT in my next window as I didnt complete IPT this window?"
Hi what do we do during RT? Got any choice?
Does anybody know how fast will ippt results take to be reflected on ns.sg?
"i supposed this is the first time RT for u?  there are a few colours representing the type of activities u want to participate in.  since u going to have many upcoming RT sessions, u have lots of time to try out every single colour."
about 2-4 working days for the result.  incentives and half-day service pay will be credited about a week later.
Thanks for info! Are all the colours the same length of exercise or do some finish early. Any one has info on what each colour does?
"the colors reflect the intensity of the training, green is for losing weight. For all the bbfa people like me. Training not tough and more on trying to help you lose weight. Also they will look out for you, more for unfit people.  The yellow is ippt training, standard training  There's one red or orange i think is for cardio training, damn tough. Halfway I fallout, if you bbfa like me take green or yellow. Yellow is you like your 10 session or so your body more trained.  Green for those early session, for me I 2 year 1 RT......so 2 year exercise other than sex, must take it lightly at the start. Else 15min in, drop out le."
"for the colours, i was hoping that u could had make used of info avail online to get them...  however if u need to be spoon-fed... look up at Q11 under this link: https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...ns_and_answers  btw for red is mainly running. and green is for this obese people whose BMI is above the range.. doubt u can opt for this if your BMI is below the obese-range.  duration wise all about the same, depending on your trainer, the time u guys took to complete every sets of exercises, and the time taken to resume training from water breaks."
Khatib FCC ippt resumes on the 23rd April. Just had a check when i booking.
Does anyone know how late you can be for RT before they count as invalid? So like what is the latest reporting time for the 6pm/7pm sessions? I have difficulty leaving work early  Thanks to zerorage and Calander for useful info!
Latest I saw 15mins after start time. But if u late already still ba long long go in pro all these with no sense of urgency. Then if I'm the admin I also won't let u in pro. Haha. Sent from Samsung SM-G965F using GAGT
"welcome.. 15mins max from the start of schedule (6pm session last timing shall be 6:15pm) if weekdays session arent convenient for u, u can consider weekends at both FCCs or in the park (park is non IPT-IPPT sessions only)."

What is the use of having the IC check when going into the camp if they don't even scan our IC?  They also did not have a pen to tick off those that have arrived on the paper.
what toking u ah dont understand u u refering to at guardhouse? u try gatecrashing with others' ID good day good luck and good health tot tt time there was the news of the person kena caught for cheating at ippt by using other pple's IC to clock attendance to take and pass the test?
"I would like to ask that if i have finish my RT, do i still need to finish my IPT?"
No. Your PTI should had briefed u during RT-IPPT.
"Guardroom only verifies that you are the person who had registered for IPT, RT or IPPT. They do not in-pro that is why. As long your name is in the list, you may enter. Or you have a better idea on how they should verify NSmen for entry?"
"Calander wrote: Guardroom only verifies that you are the person who had registered for IPT, RT or IPPT. They do not in-pro that is why. As long your name is in the list, you may enter. Or you have a better idea on how they should verify NSmen for entry? Ya talking about the guardroom matching the IC against the paper. 1. Process often not computerised, hence no record who they let into the camp 2. Did not use a pen to tick away those whom they allowed into the camp, often resulting in more time to search for our names on paper. Hence, on record there's only in-pro timing. From security point of view, there should be record on entry into the camp."
Suggest you feedback to mindef directly
"""record on entry into the camp"".. they can always counter-check with FCC in-pro counters. if in the event such NSmen cleared guardroom but failed to register at FCC, means that NSman could have went to other areas which are not authorised. In such situation, any personnel on-site has the authority to ask for camp pass and should it fail, the on-site personnel can report for security action. for your point 2, it does not matter as the names are arranged in alphabetical order. so with or without ticking-off does not matter... but brings more hassle than it require."
"Khatib FCC confirmed resuming IPPT on 23rd, running is done at carpark area instead of the track"
"Trying to boook ippt, my current windows is RT. Thursday Maju fcc 1800 is ippt ? When I book never show ippt. Only show RT.  so report at fcc tell them I coming for ippt 1800 slot? Correct."
you mean ur 8th session? tell them RT-ippt.
"Hi guys, i will be facing an upcoming IPPT default charge. Many times already. Lost count. My last year somehow i managed to act pity and kenna charge $200 only. My question is, 1) will they send u to DB before they charge u the maximum? ($500) 2) What can i do now to on my part to help myself? I do have some medical problem, see doctor get letter ? OR must see a specialist? 3)is there ANYONE or someone here who knows someone who actually went DB for IPPT defaulting ?  My hope is that since my last fine was only 200, MAYBE they will still give me 1 more chance or something..coz i think by right DB should be the last resort, after they have done everything they can to you but you still dont want go ippt THEN they will throw you inside right ?  lastly i advise all those who are suffering from IPPT laziness to get just get it done..once a month RT also can... now really regret liao.."
no need to think about anything now. you just prepare to clean ur butt and go in and squat!
Can dropout halfway for 2.4? Is it still counted as attempted?
"if drop out half way, no count, attendance no count also.  If really cannot liao, just walk, at least clock the attendance. Walk like senior citizen speed also can."
"either u complete 2.4 regardless pass or fail, or the instructors call u to fall-out."
"Thanks for the reply from both seniors. Just to clarify, as long as I complete 10 IPT sessions means I've fulfilled my current ippt requirement for this window right?"
correct.. regardless pass or fail the IPT-IPPT.. just clock attendance will do.

"So i failed to complete my RT for my current window due to poor planning and heavy school work.  This is my first time, what should i be expecting? And when will the letter come that tells me to report to cmpb?"
Nvm answered my own qns  Sent from OnePlus ONEPLUS A3003 using GAGT
Yes you can.
"you should receive the letter b4 ur next window starts. once you receive it, wear smart 4 and report to cmpb to see the charging officer. explain whatever you want then pay a fine and on the spot book ur RT dates for the year. then you can go. RT is brutal, we all know. maybe you want to consider IPT? if not try to train up as much as possible and take the ippt and pass it at least. i am an nsmen and i have done 8 icts so far. yet i can do between pass and pass with incentive."
"what platform are u using? Chrome, Firefox, Edge?"
"I HATE the push up machine ! Did 50 push up and it only register 44. I go down to chest about 1 fist away from floor, the machine does not register. I need to touch the floor with my chest then it register. I know curved back will not register but that is not the problem for me. I also straighten my arms and go up all the way. For me the machine want me to kiss the floor then it want to count as pushup. Anyone got tips on how to make the machine count every pushup ?"
Come to Khatib camp. The stations are new and do not have such problems.
did you feedback to the PTI just beside you?
"machine uses first few counts for calibration. so dun go too low right from the start.  also heard during ict that before you enter the mat, you stand at the machine wait for the chime, it is actually calibrating the machine to your body measurements, so dun slouch or keep fidgeting. (this one hearsay dunno how true)"
"No chime when i did 8th ict ippt recently. Just walk to arrow and stand beside and wait for the red words to appear. Place tag to start, get into position and start pushing it down. I did 40 standard push ups in a min"
"Hi guys, im about to go for my very 1st ICT, i heard that we will do IPPT during ICT period. So do we need to book for any IPPT by ourselves or they will help us settle everything? Thanks."
"Depends on your ICT unit. Some will have IPPT, some won't"
Now you have 2 years to complete your RT.
"You will take ur ippt in camp during ict. Unless you have alrdy clear ur ippt during that window then no need to take.  And no need to book, ur unit will org it in camp. And pls pass if not after ur ict you are on ur own to book outside"
"Just to add on - Certain reservist units have a tad more stringent requirements for IPPT-related matters. In my case, they told us that as long as you do not attain IPPT Gold in your window, you will have to take ICT-IPPT. A perma-IPTer like me has to take IPPT three times a year, hahaha."
May I ask a generic question on IPT? The ns.sg system used to show for example 5/10 sessions... but currently this feature is disabled.. how do you check the remaining sessions for IPT/RT?
"not sure about this feature being disabled as it should be there.  alternate way in checking is to see your out-pro IPT slip. The counts stated in the slip excludes that particular day's session.  edit: - have checked.. the counts on how many sessions attended should be shown in your main IPT booking page.

"Tmr going to take IPPT with full machine set up. First time, got any tips? Only hear about the push up first rep don't do too low else, then sit up sometimes need to slam your back against the machine. or these all hearsay?"
Hi just to check with anyone. I am 39 yrs old but recently I fail my ippt does it mean that I need to complete 20 RT when I am 40 next yr. As my MR is 40 yrs old. Thanks.
then just wait for ICT time to do ur IPPT lor. save all the trouble about booking for IPPT etc
"Guys if not enough time to clear RT cycle. Is it possible to book multiple attempt to clear IPPT? Assuming 8th session is my RT-IPPT. How to ensure that if i fail certain station, i can just clocked as absent so i can re-attempt it again?"
"The system is very clear. For RT-Ippt if fail, u will continue with the normal RT sessions until the next stipulated RT-Ippt.  And u cannot book any IPPT seperately."
"If your nex window is MR, unit may easily waive off your IPPT failure."
"What i meant is to re-attempt RT-IPPT forgoing the remaining RT sessions as i know i cannot make it in time.. 8th session (if i know i can't pass push up or sit up - i will void it as absent since i didn't attend 2.4km or drop out halfway), rinse and repeat until i pass."
"meaning you want to see your push-up/sit-up performance that day before deciding you want to continue with the test?? the PTIs always say to those who just follow through motion for the IPPT attendance only, to run minimum 2 laps before you can fall out (you get a 59:59 timing), but get your attendance counted. by this logic, maybe you can try falling out before the run, geng not feeling well and pray your attendance not counted. this way, you will be forever booking an 8th session. btw, how long more till your window closes?"
Yes u get what i mean already. Roughly 2 - 3 weeks before it closes.
"The push up new machine is crap.they use first few rep to gauge your rep for the rest of the set. So if you do swee swee 3 to 4 times, that is the benchmark. So basically introducing this systems is like forcing people to do half **** so that their rep will count. Liddat do ippt also meaningless"
"as long as u failed RT-IPPT, u need to continue the remaining RT until it reaches the next RT-IPPT. u cannot retake the 8th session again."
is ippt for khatib camp up? last i check it was closed for field maintenance and now i cnt find any info online  Sent from Sony I4293 using GAGT
"ippt is back but track not fully done, so the ippt route is 6 rounds around the FCC."
"Ipt nowadays do not give half day allowance already ? went for my 2nd and 3rd session put sms telling me allowance credited only after the 3rd session. Plus, reply the instruction to get know the amount, nothing happens.  edit: checked ns portal. they paid 10 days later. ipt on 18 may, payment on 28 may. Still thought it normally credits like within 3 business days..."
"all payments are about within 2 weeks time. unless IPPT at Maju FCC if i am correct, is that they are now using the new system to pay NSmen for IPPT incentives on the day itself."
Just a quick question. What are the timings for Saturday IPT/IPPT sessions at Bedok FCC?
"A quicker answer to your question is u can find them in the NS portal. Or u can see the sessions in the booking page.  Long story short. Plus, u need not have to wait for people to answer your questions here whereby u can find it instantly easily."
"If I have some injury which make me unable to go for my ippt, what should I do? I can't find any portal for me to submit anything"
"u can just be absent for the IPPT. No fault will be made against u. Book another IPPT session after you have recovered at least after next 3 days.  unless if your injury requires consideration for your unit to defer your IPPT window, then u will need to contact your unit directly for medical review."
"Currently I still got 18 sessions for RT, but for now til September all the dates are unavailable to book. My window expire on March 2020, I don think i have enough time to go for RT since the slot is only on Friday. What will happen if i never clear in time?"
No availability until sept? Cannot believe.  Never clear in time of course get into trouble lor
"Yup.. I just went online and checked. Til September, all date unavailable to book."
for one FCC?
Both HTA and ITE College East
Book at FCC.
"where are the locations which u can do your RT?  if all the locations are not avail until Sep, means u need to contact your unit for their consideration for extension or waiver."
Only HTA and ITE College East
"Checked, no available dates til September"
Check with you guys: RT sessions on Saturday used to be 430pm and now they have changed it to 6pm?
Do you plan to contact your unit?
"No at the moment, will contact them after a few weeks. maybe there's a bug in the system."
"So if u eventually cannot complete in time, but doing this you are opening the door for them to say that, you already know is an issue and you choose to drag. then u end up face the music."
Hmm... Thanks for the advice. Will contact them soon
So far has the Khatib fcc started on using paynow as heard from the news?
Hi does anyone knows what's the outcome for me whether paying fine or going DB. As this time is my 4th times defaults of complete RT 20 cycles. Being told to go CMPB next mth for the summary trial.
A friend of mine a decade least never go for any RT/IPPT All he do was report in no4 pay $ and bye bye Repeat Annually
Any reasons he give to the officer?
Will everybody be so “lucky”?
Quick question: Bedok FCC (for IPPT) uses machine for push up and sit up ? Same like Maju camp ? And the 2.4km running track is the stadium?
for a start  no i don't know
Yes that’s right. Machines for both push up and sit up. And the running track for the 2.4km run.
Thanks
4th time should be a veteran offender and should be telling us the outcomes instead.
"SAF ippt incentive reward, does it come in by ""SAF IMPREST ACCOUNT SUPP"" ?"
Now all machine. Nabei lol
All machines  Would like to ask. Is it better to do wide arm push up? So that the distance to go down is smaller?
"yo guyss, just want to ask,  rightnow my enlistment is on 30th october, if i change PES, do you think it will be pushed further to november/dec or will it be brought forward to Aug/Sep?  really think no point if i change PES but enlistment date pushed further cuzz i want to enlist asap.  thankss"
You enlisting into HomeTeam or SAF? Cause I do not see any enlistment date in 30th Oct tho. What’s ur PES status right now? Temp PES or perm?
Does anyone knows the meaning of SAF 264?
"i got PES BP when i went for checkup last yearrr, but now i lost weight slightly & now my BMI is below 27, about 25-26. thats why hopefully can bump up my pes to B1 at least? but i dont want to push my enlistment date furtherr"
"Call CMPB and clarify about it. Did you pass ur IPPT? If yes I’m sure they will put you with those PES fit intake ASAP (early Oct) but if you failed, likely you will be enlisting the earliest slot which is on November."

It is a letter that you will receive if you have not attempted any IPPTs or unable to complete your RT in the window.

Anyone went to bedok camp recently? are they still anal about dress code before entering camp for ipt/ippt?
"Yes they will always be anal about dress code.  The reasons you are not called out is: 1) The people pretended not to see or humji dont say 2) They practised not looking at what you are wearing.   If you don't believe, you can ask them ""Hey I am wearing slippers. Can I enter the camp?"""
Wide arm pushups is not allowed. You can try to push the limit by making it wider and wider.
"It's just dumb, I was in PT attire, booked in and then got called out to tuck in my tshirt. 5 steps after I walked through the gate, i pulled my tshirt back out like everyone else. Really -_-"
"There’s a lot of dumb things happening. It’s all about optics and in a way also to protect their ass. Because if you kena caught and higher ups question those people at the gate whether they told you to tuck in, at least they can touch their heart and say yes."
"Just went for my 1st RT session, is there a way to book RT-IPPT for 8th session? or just book RT like normally?"
Book normally but need to choose a slot that has IPPT. Then just report to IPPT counter and they will know one
The safety officer talked for 30min today. Wtf man

Yr 0 is optional. Only from Yr 1 is mandatory.
"So if I take the ippt next week, it's considered as year 0?"
yes. year 1 starts from Jul'20 after your next bday
"Anyone ride motorcycle into bedok camp before? Is there a place to park?  I intend to ride in wearing pt kit, don't think they will stop me right?"

"Hi , I would like to ask is the sms for ippt booking confirmation (reminder) a must in order to enter the army camp for ippt?? What if i booked the ippt on ns portal but i did not received the sms reminder, will i be denied entry? If my name is in the nominal roll but i do not have the sms , will i still be able to enter to take my ipt-ippt?"
It is always better to keep the sms.  In Kranji camp usually the guards will just check the nominal roll against the 11B but just in case your name doesn't appear in the nominal roll for some reasons you may show them the sms to prove that you have a IPPT/IPT/RT scheduled on that time slot.

I heard carpark or underground whichever it is."
You will be running in a sheltered carpark. Quite cooling. No need to worry about raining and being cancelled halfway.
Thanks boss. Hopefully the push-up machine will do me some justice tmr.

It might be possible that MINDEF is removing Bishan Park as one of the IPT-In-The Park venue? Last time I encountered the same issue when I tried to book sessions in Jurong Central Park which was removed from the IPT-In-The-Park due to low attendance.
Most likely fully booked. I'm going Monday session. I booked like 1+ month in advance

"Ask u all ar, why ppl still do rt when there is option to do ipt and clear half the time? Whats the catch? I intend to fail afterall.. no need the money"
"From what I obverse, there are mainly 2 type of people: 1. people who totally don't know about the IPT scheme, they thought fail IPPT must go for RT is the only option available. 2. people who are confident of passing, then wait until last minute to take IPPT, then they didn't manage to pass, had to go for RT."

Has anyone done ippt recently at Khatib? Is the running track still torn up in a number of parts or have they already replaced it?

Should be subject to RT if you did not meet the requirements even if you’re turning 40 as it’s still ur IPPT Window tho.
"To all HomeTeam NSmen, I noticed when I did my non-ICT IPPT at FCC(I’m a SAF NSman), you guys find it hard to use the static machines to achieve ur desired scores. I suggest either you book for IPT and train(if you want to) at the FCCs, request to FI to use the machines and find ur momentum at each static stations.  Don’t get angry when the machines did not count your Reps. SAF static machines are really strict and it seems to capture your body position.  Or, best way is to just book at HTA(Police) and NSTI(SCDF) as all of you are used to the protocols there. Although it’s hard to find time for trainings especially when you’re at work but having a just Pass for IPPT(51 point) can relief yourself from burden.  Cheer up and all the best! 😬"
"long time ago it was 3 big rounds around part of the camp then it changed to running around the indoor carpark ""track"" hard ground....(no rubber track to cushion) dont think it has changed. so yea, you'll probably be breathing in dust and stale air for 6 rounds."
I went there recently. Not bad afterall tho plus it’s indoor and convenient.
"effective MR date is start from 1 Apr each yr  since u say u complete 10 ICT but havent officially MR, so u MR effective 1 Apr 2020 onwards?  then from now till 31 March 2020, you are still liable to clear IPPT/RT etc"

do absolutely nothing == IPPT defaulter charge + RT for 20/21 attempt and fail == RT for 20/21 have you considered being IPT regular so you just do 10 sessions each window? rather than 1 IPPT (fail) in one window then 19 (RT) the next window.....or are you the type who prefers 2 years do one long burst of physical activities??
"Very interested to know the answer for this loophole. These past 2 years, there were a few guys in my coy who are exploiting this loophole.  For some, the active window is just an IPPT-window. Meaning if they fail, they're just avoiding RT by virtue of the MR date.  For others, the active window is a RT-window. Meaning if they fail the ICT-IPPT and bo-chup RT totally, they are essentially using the MR date to avoid a RT defaulter charge which i think is more serious (avoiding a punishment for a punishment). I'm curious to know how SAF view this issue.  Unfortunately i'm not close to any of them, so i don't know the outcome of their cases. None of them reaching 40 yet."

"1st session is a categorisation test, last session is another test to see if you meet your category/band standards or improved from your category. Just tank both sessions. And follow through motion for the 8 trainings in between."
no need to pass. just go for attendance will do.
some others would be wanting to squeeze one more IPPT award before they MR for good... easy $200-500 for em...

"Hello, I failed my IPPT at SAFRA last weekend because I stepped off the treadmill like an idiot.  I'm trying to get used to running on the treadmill in another gym, which happens to have the exact same treadmill model, but I can't remember/am not sure how to input the settings implemented in the IPPT at SAFRA. How do I ensure that the machine makes me run for 2.4km at a speed of 10.0 instead of slowing down close to the end of the run? Also, is the gradient set at 0.2 or 2.0?  Any advice regarding the treadmill settings is highly appreciated, as I'm attempting the IPPT again this Sunday. Thank you."

"instructors will ensure the gradient is set to the standard which I can't remember how much (only did once). Speed wise depends on your math calculations. Either u maintain one speed throughout, fast then slow, or slow then fast. The speed really depends on individuals. If u still have issues with treadmill, go for IPT.. 10 sessions per window and the test is free and easy. Another best reason to name is gym doesn't give you any incentives if u are to qualify for incentives, but IPT-IPPT has."
I defaulted my IPPT for my pervious window and the new window comes. It states that I need to attend 20 RT to fulfill this window IPPT requirement.  I have yet book nor attend any RT. However during my recent ICT I managed to pass my IPPT.  Am I still required to attend 20 RT sessions?
No. Check ns.sg for your IPPT status. It should reflect that your IPPT obligation has been fulfilled. Give your unit a few working days to send the results and get them uploaded onto ns.sg
Thanks for the clarification
"Hello, I was an NSF occifer but defaulted on my required RT sessions due to some personal circumstances. I'm probably about to get charged. Do you guys know if the consequences are any different for my situation?"
Anyone knows what’s the likely punishment if I did not complete my 20 RT within the window?  And will I still be allowed to take IPPT for the next window?
"by right the first and second failing to complete RT is a fine, and subsequent ones are DB. next window will be still RT window. The only time u can take IPPT is you are having a ICT-IPPT."
first two times fine... but amount is higher due to rank. subsequent ones will be DB. Depending on your S8.
"If during RT window, pass ICT IPPT. Than no need to go RT already?"
yes. n i strongly suggest u read-up on all information avail in NS portal.
Ohh so I can’t take my IPPT outside for the next window?
"officer what rank please be clear  certain rank think still go up to CO level to charge u if nt it's brigade commander minimum or even div comd, depending"
"RT is a form of disciplinary action towards IPPT failure and defaulters. You can only exit RT if u:  1. pass any RT-IPPT, or; 2. complete RT required sessions, or; 3. Pass ICT-IPPT.  Therefore yes... u cannot take IPPT outside.  If u want to avoid such restrictions, ensure you are not in RT. There is a program called IPT program which u can take a non-ICT IPPT at any available IPPT sessions to clear your window. Or just complete 10 IPT sessions.  all IPT sessions are payable now.  Once again. READ thru NS Portal!!"
First time going to take ippt after ord. Can just wear outside brand sportswear like adidas and straight away report to camp? Or need report in proper attire like tuck in shirt and jeans?
"u can go in with sports attire.  importantly, no slippers."
"So if I am a RT defaulted, will I still be able to exit RT through RT-IPPT instead of ICT-IPPT? And will I still get my incentives if I managed to pass with incentives even though i’m a RT Defaulter?"
Okay thanks for the reply!
i can't help you anymore if you simply do not understand my replies and you failed to still read thru the NS portal.  and you will have to give me your incentives if you get to receive from passing RT-IPPT or ICT-IPPT with incentives as you have doubts despite having the answers readily available to the public.
Hazy today. How do I know if IPT will be cancelled?
Only when psi exceeds 150
 Pls update status thks

Anybody know how to find out whether if we are a IPPT Defaulter? Is there any way to find out from ns portal? But i don't see any notification from the current ns portal verson mentioning like as from the previous version will mention we have defaulted ippt.
Wouldn’t you know you have defaulted?

"Now change system already.  Default ippt, just continue with rt next window.  Default rt then wait for letter."
"Hi, may i know how many point to pass ict-ippt. To avoid 20 RT"
Got diff from normal IPPT meh?
No diff. same points needed
So it will still be 51point to pass right.
"Yes pretty strict.  Guard house will want you to reach by 5pm or they may turn you away.  In-pro may just close shutter at 5.10pm, saying you are late. The last timing they will accept is 5.15pm."
ya lor. such a strange qns from him
very difficult to understand meh?
Yes  Pass (NSmen) ≥ 51 Pass with Incentive (NSmen) ≥ 61 Silver ≥ 75 Gold ≥ 85 Gold (Commando / Diver / Guards) ≥ 90

Can I know what do you do in IPT? Like what’s the training like.
Take the colour band Also. Same as rt
mindef is good to NSmen who pay u for RT.  and go read up the difference between IPT and RT. Then tell me what is the purpose in having this two programs.
"if u aren't obese (green tag only).. u can choose other colours.. info on the various colours can be found in NS portal.  you have 8 IPT sessions in which u can choose ur colour tag.. therefore, u have many opportunities to experience the different tags.  back to your question.. is all training featuring different syllabus."
"Hi guys, I need to ask. Due to my injury, I didn't complete RT (well, I'm still seeing the specialist, and abit too late to get excuse)  Hence. I prolly going to get charged; ofc I will ask my specialist to write a memo to plead for leniency.  Roughly when will I be summoned to go to CMPB? I'm afraid it coincides with an overseas trip that I have already booked. Hence, if such a case, will I be able to change the date of the summon?"
you just sustained the injury?
what kind of question is this??????
The in denial kind
"nope, it happened v long. Just that the whole process from seeing GP> Specialist is super long"
"so is there a reason why when u already know you can't do RT, you don't at least go get some sort of excuse but would rather be treated as a defaulter?"
"I wasn't able to get a long status on the get go. the process of GP to specialist take weeks to months. For a full excuse, its required you get 6 mths of excuse RMJ to be eligible to ""excuse"" ippt for this cycle. The time is simply not enough. It might sound silly, I rather be treated as a defaulter than worsening my injury."
Can't you just go see a MO to inform that you are still seeking specialist consultation and is waiting hence you can't do RT?
"I did, mo covered me for a short period (1 week). However, MO also said a medical review is needed for a long tem excuse after the specialist which is still insufficient time.  Hence forth, everything else ill just leave it to the officers to give me the judgment.  i'm here asking duration of the CMPB charge process, if its possible to reshedule the charge"
"If it is not possible, you will reschedule your your trip?"
"nah. the saf portal is down. would have emailed them. forget it, ill wait for tmr to ask"
No more la. Don’t anyhow say. It has changed for some years back.
Just do 10 ipt. And you have completed your current window (without having to pass your ippt)
once got the habit of going rt it doesn't feel that bad anymore  plus khatib fcc got chiobu FT
Is it the Malay minah?
"Yeah, just go for 10 session, 2 ippt test and 8 normal session(rt)"
Chinese zehzeh
Hi all. If i am supposed to take 20 rt this window but i only attempted 5.  Is it considered ippt defaulter or considered taken?  How many rt i have to take next window?  Sent from Samsung SM-G955F using GAGT
defaulter because never complete 20. 20.
lol this one funny leh
Hi can I book rt ippt before the 8th session?
"Hi, is there such a system change? I forgot to take my IPPT in September and now kena letter.. Thought can just continue with RT until next year September."
"No.. rt-ippt is only specifically on 8,14,20th lesson."
Especially u go on tuesday and thursday brown band..fuhhh got this xmm from poly swee
Sian sial Khatib FCC is too far for me. BTW still remembered last time if you took IPT in the park also got one chio bu fitness trainer. That was somewhere in 2017.

mai la brown shag sia
"didn't take = defaulter, charge then rt take but fail = next year rt"
"the new system is already in placed since 2014 when mindef revised IPPT to 3-stations only.  previous and the current system is still the same. By right as long IPPT failure, should complete IPT or otherwise charged to perform RT.  Here say some people got sms as warning, some got letter (for your case).  The main differences between the two systems are 5-stations to 3-stations IPT is payable only 10 sessions of IPT to clear your window PTIs out-sourced to Certis Cisco Flexibility in the 20-D concept"
"if knowing IPPT will fail, NSmen can attend 10 IPT sessions so as next year is not RT."
Now even RT is payable
but the korkor obviously never even go for IPT10
"now RT IPT both payable, you can even go for IPT after the 10th session for fun, but no pay. good workout for those without regiment"
all along RT is payable for both old and new system. Not even needed to be mentioned.
I duno what since I never needed RT for old system.  Posted from PCWX using XWCP
currently on RT. Window closing next week. I missed passing ippt by 2 points. I heard we can retake partial ippt. Either run or static. Can anyone verify this?
the topic was about the difference between the old and new system. nevertheless thanks for your contribution
i believe partial is only allowed for statics station.  best call NS portal to enquire. Maybe can even ask for waiver by your unit as it is possible.
I'm currently on rt for 2018 window. Attempt a few sessions. My new window for 2019 open recently. I manage to pass my ICT-ippt after my window for 2019 opened. Do I have to book another session of ippt for 2019 or wait for 2020 window to open?

"just wait for a few days after your ICT-IPPT.. if u are cleared, your ns portal will indicated that you have cleared your window. From there just wait for your next window  am curious to ask you.. since u had ICT-IPPT, u had many peers to actually ask this question.. as well as there are many peers who might in the same situation as u"
"If I take my second IPT-IPPT (during my 10th IPT) and get enough points for pass with incentive/silver, do I qualify for the $200/$300? Or do I qualify for the incentives only when I clear my IPPT during a non IPT-IPPT?  Am I good for my IPPT window as long as I attend 10 IPTs? Or does it need to be 10 IPTs + 1 separate IPPT attempt?  Thanks in advance!"
"Qualifies. If you managed to even just pass for 1st/2nd IPT-IPPT, automatically count as cleared for the window. Even if failed 2nd IPT-IPPT still count as fulfilling your window already nowadays."
what is the max ippt and ipt session combined u can take while still getting rank pay? Is it 20 sessions for both either ippt or ipt? or can mix and match?
"only max. 3 IPPT is payable (inclu non-ICT IPPT, ICT-IPPT, IPT-IPPT and RT-IPPT combined).  considering NSmen takes and complete 10 IPT that includes 2 IPT-IPPT, he may book a separate non-ICT IPPT to get that additional service pay and maximise it/."
"wow u really very knowledgeable, thx for advice.  if i want to take more than 10 ipt to keep fit, do i still get paid after the 10th? got max? or can take unlimited ipt and keep getting paid?"
"IPT wise max payable is 10 sessions (inclu the 2 IPT-IPPT unless you have taken 2 or more non IPT-IPPT) how to maximise the payable allowance to u, i have already mentioned in the prev post. in fact all these info can be found in NS portal, or roles as NSmen webpage"
"Yes, up to 20 sessions, same as RT. https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...utions-payment"
get screamed at by Natalie is
"my ippt got gold, cont take ipt still can get paid rank pay allowance? or once gold they won't pay anymore."
you are still paid for IPT attendance
"For RT, any idea if we r late by 5min will they still inpro us?"
all the below within my ippt window:    i book 1 normal ippt and got gold and service pay.   i book another 1st ipt-ippt but never receive service pay.   Subsequent ipt sessions i booked got receive service pay.   is it ns side screw up? by right my ipt-ippt should also be give service pay rite?
inpro timing is limited to about 10-15mins from session time
"Hi can I ask, if I fail ippt I will need to go for RT right? But what if I will be overseas for a year? What will happen? Anybody know?"
Her voice so sexy...
"Regretted taking the red band at khatib fcc, other band out Pro, yet red one still doing training till 7.20pm. Can complain?"
"Red band tio pawned gaogao lo, other color out Pro, Red band still running."
"Natalie ah? Yesterday go ipt. She take blue band, sadly I took the red one."
"Actually got another trainer like Natalie, jolene. But she scream, sibei fierce sia."
Dumb questions for the ipt right total 10 session I book all and the 2nd IPPT must be last  But halfway something happen I miss out 1 or 2 ipt session  So my question is if u book my ipt after the 2nd IPPT will it be valid?
"System won't let u book IPT. To remediate this, u need to cancel the 2nd IPT-IPPT, then book the remaining sessions accordingly."
"I have a question.  Assuming if I have done my 7/20 RT session last week, and my 8th session supposed to be IPPT which example is next week.  If I have already booked the future few RT sessions accordingly, if I missed my IPPT next week, and go for my future RT sessions, will they allow for me to do so? As I am unable to make it for the 8th session which is the IPPT session that I booked. Appreciate any kind feedback and comments thank you."
"The following session that you attend after missing will be your 8th then (IPPT in your case). Let's just say you miss this too, it'd get pushed to the next booked session. Hope that answers your qn."
But my next session after missing this IPPT will be a RT session stated with no IPPT. So does this mean they will disregard the 8th session and just let it be a RT session
"Likely the same with IPT, doesnt count so best to reschedule unless u wanna take the risk to test the system.  Posted from PCWX using XWCP"
"Check again after midday of the following day, it should auto-update to reflect as RT-IPPT. It's 2 days in between sessions so if you never cancel the session that you missed, there's time for it to update and be reflected on site. Besides, in that case, you won't be able to squeeze a booking into the direct following day. So by the time the next booked day comes, it'd have been reflected in the system."
This year I fail ippt So need to do rt next year If my last ict is next June. Do I still need to clear rt next year?
"if you can clear your IPPT during ICT next year, no need to do any RT  however, noticed that you mentioned that next June is your last ICT.. regardless you clear your window or not doesn't much matter anymore."
"hi bros,  Today i went for ippt finish push up and sit up but rain. 2.4km cancelled. Is it counted as Attempted or not attempted? the result slip shown: Nullify  Damn my window closing next tuesday..... The FT said its counted but not sure whether it is anot. System now shown Not Attempted.  Thanks in advance"
by now you should have an updated status. Pls share as an update to your query. System obviously wont be updated immediately within the same day as your ippt.
Anynone know where is Punggol Park ipt meeting spot?
"Planning to try out IPT for the first time once my IPPT window open up next month, may i know how frequent can i take IPT in a week ? Is it possible for me to chiong all 10 sessions of IPT in a month ?"
have u try booking via NS portal for a start?
The only requirement is we are not allowed to do trainings on consecutive days as the day before and after training is supposed to be our 'rest days'. So it is possible to chiong all 10 IPTs within a month.  Also you might want to take note that there is no IPT conducted on Fridays.
"Yes, I always clear my ipt in a month, khatib fcc got many cb hor.. Don't say I bo jio"
"Around here, 2 long shelter beside the water body  This image has been resized.Click to view original image"
"Hi, I need some advice.  Assuming I do 10 NON-IPPT IPT, do I still need to do IPPT?  The instruction on the system is confusing.  On one page, it says IPPT must be taken on the 1st and 10th IPT session.  But then it also says that I either need to clear IPPT or 10 sessions of IPT.  I already took 5 sessions of non-IPPT IPT sessions and only have 6 months left in my window. Did I screw up?  Can I just do 10 sessions of NON-IPPT IPT?"
Just know that 1st and 10th ipt-ippt can Liao. So is 8 lessons of IPT. 2 Ipt-ippt. Complete all can Liao.
Oh ****... Does that mean I need to repeat the whole cycle again if my 1st IPT is not IPT-IPPT?
"It is exactly as it says. When u book your 1st and 10th IPT session, it must be on a slot that has IPPT. It is known as IPT-IPPT, which is mandatory in the 10 IPT sessions. Oh ****... Does that mean I need to repeat the whole cycle again if my 1st IPT is not IPT-IPPT? Does the system even allow u to book it in the 1st place?"
"Yes, the system allowed me to book 1st session of IPT without taking IPPT....already did 5 sessions of IPT.."
What is the status shown on your ns portal when u try to book IPT now? 5/10?
"This is the exact words:  5/10 IPT Attended   2 IPT Upcoming     To be on the safe side, I just now (5 mins ago) booked IPPT seperately."
"Cheese pie. Tore my ACL, still no PES C. Army really doesn’t want to let me go  Only temp B4 tmd!!"
"I dont think IPPT that is outside of IPT counts towards IPT leh... Since it says 5/10, I think it should be counted already? Somehow u went for your 1st IPT (on a slot with IPPT?) and the counter did not realise that u were supposed to be taking IPPT. I know that there are some slot where IPPT and IPT happens together..."
You need to ensure that your last IPT is IPT-IPPT. The system will automatically change to IPT-IPPT when you book your last IPT (the system will take around 1 day to update the booking from IPT to IPT-IPPT) also you need to book a slot that IPT-IPPT is conducted as well. If I am not wrong you need to attend at least 1 IPT-IPPT.
Natalie no longer working at Khatib FCC?
"if i book ipt but forget to cancel before the date, any consequence?"
Nope 10char
"She still there, but think they are shuffled between fcc.."
Left final ippt to clear before my window close next year
i hope thats the case... havent seen her around during my past 4 sessions and i noticed that her photo (profile) had been taken down from the notice board
alrdy MRed for me
"For Kranji FCC, from today onwards we have to show them our booking on ns.sg instead of the notification sms."
"Hi guys, how likely / easy is it to take ippt if I am not at the stipulated nth session for ippt?"
Any one knows if i will still need to go for the remaining 9 ipt sessions if i pass it on the first ipt-ippt ?
u dont need to complete as long u pass.  the NS portal will inform you that you have cleared your window and will also SMS you.
no later than 5mins from in-pro time
"No I mean if I am not at the 7th, 13th, etc RT sessions, can I ippt still as an exception?"
"Asked before, they said no... if u think u can pass, try booking a normal IPPT"
"As long as you are under RT, you can only take RT-IPPT at the stipulated sessions... meaning only on 7th, 13th etc. Unless there is an ICT during your window which you can have the chance to pass during this ICT-IPPT.  it is only when you are in IPT, you can book a IPPT (known as non-ICT IPPT) at any avail session."
normal IPPT is also not allowed if your window is under RT.  do try not to get into RT. Clear your window with IPT instead as there is more flexibility.
"Yes... IPT is much better, even got those in the park one where the training quite low tempo (some times they do yoga)."
"Thanks guys, good tip not to get into RT since its so rigid. I'm pretty sure I can pass but just that not sure if I can clear till the 7th session before my birthday in March."
"If go RT, dun have 7hours of sleep how?"
i got a qn regarding IPPT. I am 36 years old. I did my blood test already however i did not get call up for my medical review nor get my HSP Cert.  Can I still go and take my IPPT? Or they will ask me to present my cert?  Please advise.  Thank you
actually ipt is alot better than rt. just enrol into ipt whenever your window open and go once every month. after ipt you pass or fail also dont matter. Doesnt sound bad.
"hi all, gonna be attending my first RT after 4years..  saw you guys talking about the red, blue, brown band. What are those? Are they different trainings with different intensity?  also, will be going to Khatib FCC, during in-pro do I need to exchange pass at the guard house? Or do I just drive in straight away to the FCC?"
"Red = more running, blue = more upper body / circuit training, yellow = ippt focused training (balance of running and upper body training), green (for BMI > 27?) and brown is sports and game I think? When u drive in to Khatib FCC, either show your SMS notification or NRIC where they will check again nominal roll (depends on person checking, some will ask for NRIC). No need to exchange pass"
"They will just discharge you, no attendance"
huh? i dun think so. becos if everyday no 7hr of slp....
"Disaresta wrote: Red = more running, blue = more upper body / circuit training, yellow = ippt focused training (balance of running and upper body training), green (for BMI > 27?) and brown is sports and game I think?

Red is basically run and run and run Blue is circuit training Yellow is IPPT based training Green is for BMI >27 Khatib FCC...The last time I go during weekends, seems to be no more games ? The next best option is blue, then yellow. If you arrive late, very often left with red only. I am assuming it is the same scenario for the other FCCs..."
"theMKR wrote: huh? i dun think so. becos if everyday no 7hr of slp.... I have seen before people being pulled out...  So it is obvious most people don't declare at all.  If nothing happens during training then ok. If something happens, the question is how ?"
"Ya... if really kiasi, then sleep all u want then go weekend in the afternoon lor"
"last time i dun declare, but got times where i just lie down and KO sleep during water break. but now old liao and got many loans to pay, dun want to die/injured over RT la, unless i am fully covered and insurance will fully pay."
"i havnt got more than 7 hours of sleep for like the past 10years or more.....  i work for 2coy, run a biz, volunteer and some serious home improvement program.  used to be able to get money from ippt but now just no energy"
So you are asking if you can just don’t do RT cause you can’t get 7 hours of sleep cause of your own decision?
"i can answer you...... but what is the point of your question....  but i will say it anyway, i want to ask what is SAF official stand when the servicemen declares that they did not have 7 hours of sleep."
"Didn’t know this place is the official mouthpiece of SAF. But anyway, Thought KuNiangSheng replied you?"
"Then opt for ipt, do 10 instead of doing 20 rt per year... Posted from PCWX using XWCP"
Any idea after 36 years old. Do i need to present my FFI before i can take my ippt?
IPT no money and cannot claim MUP
do get your facts checked.. IPT has 0.5 day service pay
"standard is 35 yrs old... unit will contact u for FFI. Otherwise in doubt, call NS hotline.  And yes. FFI needed to be cleared before u can take ippt"
"Work for 2 coy, run a biz still care about the amount of money from IPT/RT..."
Then just pass your IPPT lor.
you are right. they do not allow me to take. :-(
"Hi all, I missed my IPPT window and have to go for RT now. Officially online states that the 8th, 12th and 16th sessions are IPPT - if pass, no more RT.  I'm also reading here and there online that the 1st session is IPPT as well? Is someone able to clarify that for me? Thanks.  Also, what are the chances that the Officer-in-Charge let you take IPPT before your 8th session?  ""If you would like to take your RT or IPPT before the scheduled IPPT session, e.g. your 8th session, please approach the Officer-in-Charge at the Fitness Conditioning Centre (FCC) during your RT for advice."""

"once u are in RT, only 8th, 12th and 16th is IPPT called RT-IPPT. the 1st session which is IPPT only applies for those under IPT (voluntary 10 sessions in total). the shortcut to clear your RT window without having to complete all sessions is during ICT, do pass your IPPT during ICT (known as ICT-IPPT). however sadly, many NSmen does not have ICT.. so can only go for non-ICT IPPT, IPT or RT"
How long in advance do i need to book my ipt slots ? Can book on actual day in the morning then attend ipt in the evening ?
Can.. before 12 noon

"Hey guys,my next rt session will be with ippt (8th session), is it possible to book for a safra location(currently pending 7th session completion) for the treadmill ippt?"

"Hi just want to seek advice. Took IPPT today and turns out I failed miserably (30 points) My IPPT window is closing by 31 Mar [last IPPT date 28 Mar].  Should I just train for the next 3-4 weeks and book one on early Feb or opt for IPT sessions instead? For IPT, is it possible to clear 10 sessions on time?"
Try choose safra location when booking online
"That will depend on how many days per week u are able to commit. Lets say u can go for the maximum 3-4 times per week (Mandatory 1 day rest in between each session), should be able to clear within a month. IMHO, you should go for IPT while also training to try and pass your IPPT. In the event if u are not able to complete your IPT or pass your IPPT, at least these sessions will be used to shave off the amount of RT u need to do in the next window. Doing IPT and IPPT also will have 0.5 day rank pay"
do you think you will be able to train religiously for the next 3-4 weeks to make a difference?
My windows usually ends on Mid Feb and I tend to start my IPT on early Dec and my last session tend to be on end of Jan or early Feb. If you attend IPT once or twice per week it is possible to complete your 10 IPT sessions if you start your 1st session next week.
Or just sign up for ipt the moment your window opens and do a session once a month. Then no need to chiong. lol
So what you mean is I should go for IPT sessions from now on but at the same time book an IPPT session on a separate date [e.g around early Feb]?
"I think I am able to do my training on some weekdays and on the weekends. Should I just focus on improving my running for my training? For some reason, the machines for the pushups/situps stations did not detect quite a handful of counts so I got a lower score for these stations than I expected."
I agree.. should have done that last year the moment the window opened up
"There are only a few slots next week and the only time I can make it on is at Bedok FCC (which is quite far from my house) , should I just go for that one?  Also, does anyone know why are there zero slots for NSTI or SUTD?"
"""Think"" isn't good enough. You can think as much as you want, but if you can't commit, then you might as well don't do it.  That means you aren't doing it right."
"Yeah, any IPT/IPPT u took this window will be used to offset the RT for next window if u cannot complete IPT or pass IPPT."
"book a separate IPPT only if you think you can pass.  otherwise just complete your 10 sessions of IPT.  Doing IPPT but failed will allow off-setting of RT sessions in the next window (20-D). However, it will be more convenient by doing all 10 IPT instead after considering the possible charges by failing or defaulting IPPT, as well as compulsory attendance for RT.  Afterall IPT is also payable.  So, work out your sums."
"You may consider IPT-In-The-Park if you stay or work near AMK-Bishan Park, Punggol Park or Marina Bay Promenade. https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...pt-in-the-park"
"Hi i have appt to see specialist at NTFGH on 18/2 which is also the first day of my ict. My unit has allowed me to go for the appt before reporting for ict. My ippt is in June, so will I be downgraded in time to be exempted from ippt? This appt was arranged by the medical centre because during my medical review, the mo refused to accept letter from my physio and said that he would only accept specialist letter."
only MO can answer that

first time into this...  realise the IPT slot some have 'no IPPT' label on them...means the others have IPPT on top also right?  Can only book 8 slots max this month
"u seem very interested to get downgraded instead.  in fact your situation is after seeing the specialist on 18 Feb, the doctor will issue a recommendation memo to either support for excuse upper/lower limbs or any other excuses, including certain exercises depending on your condition.  As you had mentioned, your MO will only accept letter from specialist which you will have that on 18 Feb itself. Given your IPPT is in June, I do not understand what kind of answers you are trying to get here.  So as to answer to your question directly, if your specialist supports you to be exempted from IPPT, you will most likely be exempted for your IPPT in June. But the funny thing is, you having ICT starting on 18 Feb also.  Therefore, you should be concerned with your ICT-IPPT in Feb, and not in June.  Perhaps you should clarify your situation better or you are trying to smoke something out."
"Welcome to IPT. ""NO IPPT"" should only be taken note IF your IPPT session is the 1st and 10th. Meaning if your session is both 1st and 10th, make sure this slot is not your selection because the system will bounce you back eventually. This is because these two sessions has to be a IPT-IPPT. On these two sessions, report to the IPPT counter during in-pro. Otherwise, IPT/RT Counters. Between 2nd to 9th session, with or without ""NO IPPT"" doesn't matter. And yes, should be only able to book a maximum of 8 slots, because the system needs to double-check that your last session is a IPT-IPPT."
"Last year i was on IPT until session 10 when i passed it. Since my window reopen, I have again signed up for IPT with the first session next Thursday.  Question is, if on the first IPT which is a test and i passed it, am i still required to completed all remaining 9 sessions or will they take it as a passed and im done for this window ?  The reason why i enrolled for IPT is because i barely passed last time on and am not sure if i can pass it with confidence again this time. If i cannot pass it, i will go for all the remaining IPT. Anyone knows ?"
thank you. By right once you take (and fail) IPPT IPT will be 'unlocked' right? Because system says my first session of IPT is also IPPT. Meaning I'm taking 2 IPPT before my first IPT.
"You pass 1st session IPPT = cycle is complete, no need go for more sessions. If not, you will have to finish all sessions."
"1st IPT if pass means no need to complete the remaining 9 sessions. Just wait till the following window. However if you fail, u can always book a separate IPPT known as Non-ICT IPPT at any avail session within the window period. Just take note if you are under RT, u cannot book a Non-ICT IPPT, and able to clear window by either pass RT-IPPT, clear all RT sessions, or pass ICT-IPPT."
"no ""2 IPPT before your first IPT"".. only one.. unless you booked a separated IPPT"
Ippt all cancelled due to Dorscon orange ?
got shadow or not sial
did u get any SMS about the cancellation or was the cancellation true?  otherwise your post can be considered as fake news.
"Legit, they got SMS saying 8-10 Feb, all venues and activities cancelled"
Just went to ns.sg and ssrr and it seems like all IPPT/RT/IPT will be cancelled for the next 1-2 weeks at least.
Was informed by the PTI at Energyone on Sunday. No intention to spread fake news lah. Am asking for clarification. My ippt this Thursday no sms or news yet.

 U wan become ang kong kong then hw 
"Yup from what I saw in ns.sg, all the days in the next week or two are not available for booking. Not so sure for the end of the month as it would be my new IPPT window."
"anybody going to rt/ipt/ippt today at maju, can update if it is still on-going? got ippt tmr, didnt receive any news till date."
"I have dropped them an email at contact@ns.sg. No time to call the hotline to check. If i receive any updates, i'll post here."
I want book my ipt  I book ippt liao den want to book ipt say I haven't book my ippt smlj sia  So can't book ipt? This image has been resized.Click to view original image
要钱还是命 你自己想
Just got sms. all closed until end of feb. like that if window closing how?
RT liao lor...  hopefully they extend window one month sia
"Oh.. ok thanks. I was excited waiting to complete my ippt this thursday so that i can stop running till the next window open. Well, guess have to continue running."
Think you can contact your unit's S8 or DYS8 to request an extension of your window since it is not your fault.
really close until march? i haven't got that sms yet. i still got RT to chiong leh
"Don't think all is cancelled or confirmed cancelled.  ""Dear XXX  Thank you for your email dated 10 February 2020.

With regard to your IPPT session on Thursday, you may contact Maju FCC at 6559 0235 to confirm if the IPPT session will be cancelled as we had not received any confirmation if the IPPT session on 13 February 2020 will be cancelled at the moment.  Based on the latest update we have received, the system will reflect the booking for March 2020 by end of today.  We would like to suggest you to try to book for your RT session again tomorrow to book for March 2020 slots.  Should you require further assistance, please contact us at 1800 3676767, or +(65) 6567 6767 if you are calling from overseas. Alternatively, you can email us at contact@ns.sg or visit our website at www.ns.sg for more information.  We will be pleased to assist you.  Best regards, ""  Update: called maju fcc, they informed me if i dont receive any message by tonight, to call them again tmr morning to check for updates."
I just called Maju FCC. They're closed till 29 Feb. You guys can call them at 6559 0235 to verify if no cancellation SMS is sent out.
"guys if I fail to clear ippt this year and wish to do ipt next year, does it mean I have to do 20 RT on top of 10 ipt to clear my ippt for next year? I actually love going for those cuz it's easy and they pay you lol"
"can't do ipt, need to clear 20 rt"
got it tks!
Yup. Confirmed closed till 29 feb.
Anyone booking sessions at Khatib FCC got any info if they're also closed till 29 Feb too?
my window closes 5th march....does that mean i have to RT? i have only cleared 3 IPT sessions and was planning to clear 7 IPT sessions in february but they closed all...
Think you can contact your unit's S8 to request for extension of your window.
"Hey, thanks for the reply."
You can call the NS Hotline and they will divert your enquiries to your S8 or DYS8 and a few days later your unit S8 or DYS8 will contact you directly.
thanks again bro!!
faster call faster get it resolved
i called mindef hotline and they said i might have no choice bt to accept the 20 sessions RT....how does that make sense when its not my fault lol.........
Maybe you can call the NS hotline again and request for your S8 or DYS8's contact details like email or contact number so that you can contact him directly.  Many years ago when I unknowingly defaulted my IPPT (due to me being in holding list for a long time prior to that) and kenna charged I also called the NS hotline and they conveyed my message to my unit's DYS8 and a few days later my DYS8 contacted me and told me that they will gave me a chance and I did not get charged in the end.
got sms regarding all fcc and ippt or ipt closed till end feb. but suddenly receive another sms about reminder to clear my RT this window.   if i clear finish my RT but window close before i can do my ippt/ipt for this window how?
contact your NS unit and they will arrange to extend accordingly.
I called my unit but they don’t seem to know what’s going on man.  Also dropped a email to NS.sg
wah called s8...they say wait until u get charged then see how dafuq lol
call them every day to kaopeh until they give you a solution they can't charge you for calling them multiple times
 Say until like got dragon got phoenix liddat 
Actually not surprised that’s how Army does things.  To get charged first is easier on them so they take the easy way out.
maybe you were speaking to the wrong DXO. email contact NS instead and get your communications documented.
"Sian, like that cancel February RT, I have planned sessions for this month, seems like have to catch up before window closes in June T.T"
"Wah your S8 like that one.... Really suay sial to have this kind of S8 who should be helping the NSmen instead.  But anyway as it is not your fault, also Mindef got say that if your window is closing this month and you are unable to fulfil your IPPT requirement you can contact your unit for help so you have a good ground to request for extension of window."
My birthday is on start of march and I am unable to book my IPPT due to the virus. Call in and heard that they will be waiving the whole IPPT window and news will be out on 20th Feb. Anyone heard of this so far?
u will know on 20th.
now havent reach 20 Feb u tink official news can leak out early one ah mai sabo leh wait kena OSA then u know sial
 My window is supposed to close 21 Feb. This arrangement could vary from unit to unit 
means they considered you clear your window for 2019/2020? or they extend your window for you to clear?

wah good leh. haha.
"Hey guys, I attempted 2 ippt last window (8 rt sessions) but failed. Window closed a week ago without me completing 20 rt session. Will I be expecting a letter from Cmpb or not since i did not complete rt? Thanks."
u were not able to book more sessions due to RT/IPPT being cancelled for bookings for few weeks due to the virus right ?  shld have received an SMS if thats the case as per previous posters
"I meant to put 1 month ago (not 1 week)that my window closes, before the virus period. Still, have yet to receive any letter from Cmpb."
"Just want to ask something...  As a pre enlistee enlisting in may second week,would like to take my IPPTat stadium somewhere around next month, if i pass, is it enough time for them to re new my enlistment date?  PS: NS website under maintenance... cant book -.-"
if i recall on what's stated on the site. at least 2 weeks before. but u ok to push back your enlistment date to the next batch?
Haha may intake is lucky cause hari raya ph so dont need to stay for 14 days... If i got to july it will be just 14 days confinement...
The July you referring to those who pass their IPPT right?  But you may not even join that batch but the one after
Yes. And what’s the batch? Enhanced?
"So if say you are currently enlisted for May for PTP batch. But you pass your IPPT, you may still not end up in July batch if they are already full.  May end up in the next enhanced batch after July"
Ohh you mean that... but the one in july will be more rush to finish the training?
"if you concern is about rush to finish training, then why don't just go in PTP?"
"No no i am just asking , there isn’t."
dun understand
I do not have any concerns is what i meant.
"Difference between Enhanced and PTP batch is the 2 months of lesser service as NSF.  Enhanced applied if you pass IPPT. This gives your NS duration of only 1yrs 8 months.  PTP batch is for those who fails, and NS duration will be 2 year, due to the additional time for train your fitness. In another words, MINDEF wants all it's pre-enlistees to be fit and reward you as an incentive.  Enlistment period is different from Enhanced and PTP. The ""enrollment"" (if this term is more familiar to you as I believe is the term used for entering JC or Poly) for Enhanced and PTP will usually be of a different date or months.  For your info, refer to: https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/web/portal/c...listment-dates  The above link shows the past and upcoming enlistment schedule. You can see some has ""(PTP)"" indicated. So those entering NS on the dates that has PTP will only ORD exactly 2 years later. Otherwise, 1yrs 8 months.  Hope this answer your query."
1 year 10 months...
"Thanks, Actually, now i have two doubts : to go to PTP or enhanced. really sucks be in these two position now. I know its very quick to enter with PTP but i kinda stuck with the civilan life i had right now but i still try my best to change my mindset of what i am gonna face for my enlistment. I can choose to train my body fitness now and instead go for more trainings at tekong and take my IPPT inside so maybe more easily to pass since i will be heading to the gym to at least prepare myself for the physical training. Thats what i know when i keep doing research online. secondly, if i were to go for enhanced batch, which i had booked my ippt test at the stadium for the next 7 weeks (to train) so that i have 3 weeks to change my enlistment date. if passed, although i may spend my extra time in civilan life for another two months but kinda feel not used to military for so longgg and gonna chiong sua with the 9 weeks. i have asked some people i know and they all gave me an equal answer for these choices. Btw, passing score for exemption is 61 points and above right?"
"Whether you enter late or early it will still be 1y10 months or 2 years. Regardless u will still lose your civi life what diff that it makes? Also if u go for enhanced, u may not just be extra 2 months you know? It may be more than 2 months. Do you really want to delay your enlistment by that long?"
"Oh... so that is something for me to consider at the same time. Ya.. couldn’t delay no more, am tired of working outside when my salary is so low..."
yes that is a major factor.
"Yes, ICT IPPT counts. Nobody is exempted from RT (I believe so) and yes, so long as it is during your window, you can opt for IPT to siam 20 sessions of RT"
Kranji FCC can enter by KC2 gate or must enter through KC3?
camp's main gate..
Is ipt still paid? And is the payment still every week or is consolidated to be paid monthly?
"very curious how come u still can ask such a question...  IPT has been payable since 2015.  Have u been attending RT all this while, or got disrupted, or just got up-PES?  and payment is about a week after the session.  Have u even checked NS Portal??? It exists for a reason. And the forum will be better utilized for Q&As for those who could not find any answers from available official platforms. Although I know now NS Portal is under maintenance until tmr 2359hrs"
I just attempt my ippt on last sat  I just now login  System say i haven't attempt  How long will they take update?
Kranji Camp 2....  Don't think we can enter through KC3 as it is considered a different camp.
over the last wkend was system maintenance. system update for your attendance is about 3 working days. Any allowance payable is about one week later.

"we must trust our government. If the virus crisis is more impt, they will cancel all IPPTs."
"If I pass my 1st session ipt-ippt, then I go for more sessions of ipt - still got service pay?"
"yes. As IPT is a voluntary training session.  Service pay will be capped to 8 ""normal"" IPPT and 3 IPPT sessions.  IPPT session includes IPT-IPPT, non-ICT IPPT and ICT-IPPT.  To summaries, only a total of 11 sessions you will get such an allowance."
Anyone knows what 6 dasse unit is? And is it shiong for ict?
Seem like they every week maintenance le
Division Artillery Support Units  xiong or not depends on ur vocation.. and ever vocation has it own xiong.  some people can find slacking too xiong for them as it is too boring.  some people find outfield training as something fun and enjoyable.  so asking whether xiong or not is self-defined.
Cos first time taking ipt. I did search but thought may have some changes. Been more than a week but still don't see the allowance.
"corrections to my earlier post.. it is payable up to 20 sessions.  as for payment, u will get the sms. And how many working days till today since your last session? take note that is working days.. should be about 7 working days.  and suggest you refer to NS portal directly for the latest information."
Nice. I passed my ipt-ippt (1st session) and am intending to go for some ipt (up to 19 more) since I stay near punggol park. Can keep fit also. Can someone actually clear a non-ict ippt and then go for 20 ipt sessions to max out? 😂
"yes... go read NS portal for ur case 1 non-ict ippt, 19 IPT to max out"
IPT only have 10 sessions.
IPT can go as many session as u like. But is only payable for the 1st 20 sessions
"No ah, system will only allow you to book 10 sessions of IPT. Once reached, cannot book anymore."
"Yes the ""limit"" is at 10, but after u clear a session u can book again.   This image has been resized.Click to view original image    Posted from PCWX using XWCP"
10 sessions is just a requirement to clear IPPT.  One can still attend more than 10 IPTs if he wants to. Just that the 1st and 10th IPT sessions will be IPT-IPPT.
Oh didn't know that. But why would you want to go beyond the obligatory 10 (if never pass IPPT) when it's enough to complete the cycle?
Because he stayed nearby. Walked across is the training ground. Free training. Keep fit and get money too.
Although saying that it is an obligation to full 'x' amount of sessions. there will always be people who do not satisfy that number. Likewise there will be people who wants to exceed that number. Plus it is still payable.
Now still can go for IPT anot? Situation like this....
https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...easures_in_fcc
just curious if FFI is the same as HSP?
Yes.  IPT is still carrying on.
Stupid ns portal down for maintenance weekend again pui
seems like every weekend thing?
Any idea if it’s safe to go for IPT due to the virus? Will they extend the deadline?
"As long as it is not cancelled, the government deems it as safe? So you gotta make your own call."
Seem to be lor
"My IPT session today got cancelled, just received SMS.  Bday is in May. I planned to clear it in Feb but due to covid-19, I am unable to book the sessions.  Just want to know if I didn't clear my IPT in this window,  1) My next window will be 20 - N (let say I managed to attend 3 sessions before window closes), 20 - 3 = 17.  2) I book 17 RT, 1 per week. When will the IPPT be held?  3) Do I clear the window after attending 17 RT?  4) Once I booked RT, do I still have the flexibility like IPT that I absent myself from the session booked due to work?  Thank yoU!"
Is there any press release from SAF/MINDEF regarding sessions getting cancelled? My friend's IPT slot tmr kena cancelled as well. He doesn't know the reason too.
"So after clearing 10 session of ipt, how many more session can I book just to earn the incentitives?"
Natalie and jolene still at khatub fcc ma?
Going for IPPT later at FCC. No SMS stating that it is cancelled today.
then just go as usual
Should be another 10 ipt all payable.  First 3 ippt are payable but u can still take as many as u want to get incentives.
Just received sms that 26Mar2020 6PM rt is cancelled. For bedok fcc
i think all 6pm slots for ipt/rt are cancelled.  except for monday one
Bedok FCC RT only 7pm slot for weekdays. No more 6pm slot.
"fug la, i already booked until april, means all my sessions all cancelled?  what time the 7pm session end?"
"If you book 6pm slot, you will receive sms notification that session is cancelled. You need to log in ns portal to amend the 6pm slot to 7pm. Probably RT last for 1 hour so 8pm."
zzzz cannot amend for today.  tried calling the BFCC >20times since morning but the line keep engaged.
"Same. I called MINDEF and they said all 6pm sessions cancelled for now, so need to wait till coming sunday to book a new session. We'll just be marked absent for today's 6pm session."
received a call IPPT got cancelled.  EDIT: just confirmed unable to book for this week
"dont understand ur english..  and is ""got call meh"" or ""got call leh""?"
a while ago i thought Mindef announced that current IPPT window will be waived? no?  best to call 1800 number and ask
"ya, same here. Received a call from khatib fcc that this saturday's ippt is cancelled."
"(Fr: MINDEF) IPT on 29 Mar 20 0800hrs at Khatib FCC has been cancelled. Please book a new IPT. Sorry for the inconvenience. For query, visit NS Portal. Ref: LCUB5RRz-U"
Sat sun mon all sessions cancelled. Yesterday FT told us.
"wth, they cancel all the tuesday 1800hrs RT until further notice.... dun even have a date of when to resume...."
You realised what’s happening in Singapore and in the world now?
"obviously, the markets are tanking, therefore saf needs to reduce cost by providing only half the sessions."
"Looks like there is still no official news on the suspension of ICT, IPPT, IPT and RT for NSmen. Not sure about how those whom window are closing going to deal with so many cancellations."
Mine sat and today was cancelled too. They even call and informed me.
Can’t as I book wed ald

glad u not oblivious
Just to check anyone book for RT or IPPT for tomorrow slot? I receive msg inform me to turn up for RT training for tomorrow 1900hrs. But later part I received another msg saying 1700 hrs IPPT cancel.
Which FCC?
Anyway I call n check already all training will be cancel for tomorrow.
I feel it’s best they give official announcement via Facebook or sort.  They like leaving us hanging. Book already then cancel by them.
"https://www.mindef.gov.sg/web/portal...rch/31mar20_nr   ""Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs) will be closed and the conduct of Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) and Remedial Training (RT) at FCCs, SAFRA gyms and IPT-in-the-Park locations suspended. The IPPT requirements for affected NSmen will be waived."""
" Means our current window considered clear? My cycle closes next Jan, so I'm not sure if it applies to me."
Me going to MR in May now only half way to RT.How har?
Good question. My current window will close on next year Feb so got apply to me also?
Can clear 8 ipt in two weeks? I doubt can for me 😂
Cannot. Ipt must be on alternate days.  So 2 weeks =14 days. At most 7 ipts
Ya lo. So if they waive my window. I wouldn’t mind. Else I’ll need 18 sessions RT next window.
"i end july need complete IPPT to clear window, got waive?"
https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...smen-immediate
"Does this apply to NSmen where their window closes in April? My window is closing in June, and I still have 7 session to go..."
why bother... u have sms .. then dont bother...their problem if they cancelled it..
Does this apply to me? My new window opens next month
I thought they alrdy announce all cancelled until end Apr....may extend the period if the Covid-19 situation worsens
My rt window MAY close But they like that block I unable to complete sia  Will I get charge? First time facing tis incident  Thanks In advance
"Erm, COVID19 happened before? Pretty sure others first time too?"
"last year all ippt/rt got suspended for 1 or 2 months because of aloysius pang's death, don't know can remember or not."
Also suspended at Maju Camp because of Zika virus.
"I think the key now is - till 30 April, so affected window closing in April only, or till May, or till June? Maybe later must call hotline ask liao"
Wait 3 weeks for the letter. If don't have need to call hotline to check.
If there is any new info share please. I’ve email them. Still waiting for reply.
that one is more like safety time-out
They replied that I clear as many IPT sessions as possible before window closes from 1st May. Problem is the max I can book before window closes is 2 slots only.
When your window closing? And how many sessions have you attended alr?
ippt waiver means what in SAF term ?
means current window you do not need to fulfill. unless they give u a date stating when is the waiver is valid until.
So anyone confirmed if the waiver is only for april window or following months also?
Keen to know this as well
Basically copied and pasted their press release But personally think it's most likely for those window closing by 30 April or around the period. Just wait and see if got letter or not.
  

They replied my email and told me to clear after suspension. They totally don’t want to tell me am I waived for my window or not. My Window is ending first week of May
"Until end of June . So there is no waiver if your window end that time  From now until 30 april is about 1 month. For ur case, ur window most probably get extended to early July "
"Lets put it this way.  If your window end before 30 april, it is waived  If your window end after 30 april, they will extend by 1-2 months. Since they announced now until 30 april is about 1 month time  Fair enough?"
"i already called in for extension, they told me no extension...."
I MR in May where got enough time to complete RT even extend 1 mth
"they will ask you, why u early nv book, now wait last min......"

March they start cancelling already. I supposed to clear before end of April. No one can predict there will be covid 19.
MR where need complete rt? Just MR and they can't do anything after u MR?
Or you may contact your unit's S8 to seek help.
"i think what u meant is u doing last ICT in May 2020  however effective MR date for u will be 1 Apr 2021 onwards  from now till effective MR date, you are still liable to clear your outstanding obligations/clear all charges before effective MR in Apr 2021"
"My window close may. Called in, saying it is waived for this year."

After 4th. Ya waive for this window
"most S8 useless one.  mindef feedback unit still more effective, just that they reply ultra slow, simple question can take month...."
I receive MINDEF letter stating that my IPPT window is waived liao.
WAH YOUR STATEMENT SIBEY SWEEPSTER SIAL
I have not received the letter yet.....
"if you consider the ""power"" they are given, you know its true la. mindef feedback unit still have more effective"
If U Say Until Liddat Win Liao Lor U Towkay
"wah so triggered, u work as S8 or head manpower arh?"
"Having Ops Manning this week, any chance of getting called back? Haha"

the only no chance is no manning.  so don't ask nonsense.
I think it depends on your luck whether you have a good S8 or DYS8. My unit's DYS8 is quite good and he had helped me to solve an IPPT issue many years back but too sad that it seems like he will be stepping down this year.
Just received the letter stating my ippt window is waived for this year.
"i think my S8 is good, just that he wasnt given enough ""authority"" so regardless of his efforts, the end result is still unfavorable. had to escalate to mindef feedback unit lor"
that is for birthday May batch ?

Mine is last quarter of the year. Not sure will they waive or not.
Depends on the covid-19 situation then?  Hopefully the situation is already better. Think that’s probably more important than whether they waive?
Not about that. Just checking if they waive ippt for everyone for year 2020.
Sg army damn gu niang until must remove pullups from ippt
You from which army?
agreed. and the army should detain you into their DB.
"once u MR , need not take RT , cant call u back for anything.  So just relax."
Then u from which heroic army?
"US army fitness test also only consists of sit up, push up and run. dun think they are gu niang."
Good for u my discharge in end of May n I call up n ask will I be charge if I never complete my RT for last work yr.Being told after the FCC open go clear as much as possible if not may also be charge too.
OT: will mob manning still be activated?
You will know when you get activated


this one no one can answer dey
Is it true that all IPPTs are cancelled until further notice for both NSmen and NSFs?
"Yes, CB still ongoing for now"
So they expect people to chiong their RT if their window is July or Aug ah? People need to work even harder after the CB is over.
Did they say that or that’s your assumption?
 Write in to Mindef if you have trouble clearing before your window close. I wrote in recently and they reply will waive off for my current window.
Whats the update now for ippt?
Keen to know. Hope they make it optional to take this year. Duno why they die die want to hold IPPT when u need to crowd around

"All the FCCs closed till 30 Jun. Currently, booking starts for 1 Jul onwards. But what actually happens, we will have to see how the reopening goes lor."
"Want to ask, currrently i have self-booked IPPT on July. But my division want us to clear IPPT asap( dont know why since my window until next march) and they booked one slot earlier then my self-booked one.  My question to experts: if pass on the first one, the subsequent booking can dont go? i cannot cancel my self-booked one!"
"Can la, pass or not, if you never show up for your own booking, it'd just mark you as absent (if never pass) and you can always book another session if you want to."
what division is this ? don't they realize it is a bad time to be forcing people to congregate during this period ?!
My window close in 2 week of July and I haven't attended a single session of Ipt. How sia... Will be waived off?
"If they don't waive and u kena charged, u say your defence is CB lor"
Alright thanks! but i heard hor if never will kena charge?
"Cannot specify scared kenna, all i can is its wear blue uniform de"
isn't it a unit rather than a division ?
"best to check with your unit, or division."
SPF classifies themselves as Division as all NSmen are managed by one division.  Whereas under the SAF is the respective units handle the NSmen.
"just think of it that you are not the only one... and to be safe, contact your NS department.  btw it is your responsibility to actually start as early as possible to clear your window.. why wait till the last minute and bring all excuses into the picture? Luckily now everyone has a more valid excuse which is the CB."
"my responsibility is to complete it within the given window. Not to start as early as possible. That is a privilege. Don't talk down like you're an officer. We are on an open forum, not within SAF. It's funny that you are saying Circuit Breaker is an excuse for NSman to abuse when it is a legitimate reason that had affected countless sinkies' livelihood and also brought upon negative impact to NSmen's lives. Please note that while various countries had stopped all mass gathering, Singapore Govt was still adopting a wait-and-see approach. I was supposed to be mobilized in early March, only for it to be cancelled on the very day itself. This is despite various countries including South Korea, had cancelled all military training so as to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I opted not to attend training sessions since then because COVID-19 is extremely infectious and unknown. This is so as to not endanger my family's life and colleagues at my workplace. Just in case, you're not aware given how socially obtuse you are in your response, this is being civic-conscious and doing my small part in not spreading it further. What happened if we NSMen were to be infected during training sessions? Can't believe that you are simply shaking it off a serious issue which is COVID-19 to be just a convenient excuse for NSMen. TLDR: It's not NSMan responsibility to complete their window ASAP, neither are both COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker ""Excuses"" for those Sinkies who are unable to complete within the given window."
"ah, thought it was NDU due to the blue unform. lol."
haha.. NDU doesn't classify themselves as a Division. If yes then commandos itself is a division too. Not a Bn.
"yes you are right. But by leaving it to the later stage and risking yourself from possible charges and getting the inconvenience that arises from the administration, or to clear early without having the worry to contact who and so on. This is your choice to choose. For your case, the only option for you is to contact NS portal or PNSD to clarify and seek extension. But for this covid incident, the govt may release an official statement on this extention."
"This I can relate. I was studying part time and holding a full time job. Took an engineering degree which involves lab sessions in weekdays. 4 lessons a week not including the assignments and projects. The only time I can rest properly is 2 days. I usually clear the sessions during semesters break. And sometimes, work simply doesn’t allow me to leave early. I have to reach FCC by 6:45pm latest maybe 7pm? If I’m lucky they will let me in pro.  However this year is different. I can clear the window in one month. I started in Feb with a 3 months buffer but sessions were either full or cancelled. To be honest I’m worried about the covid evolving situation at that time. But I still have to do my best to clear as many sessions as possible. The situation is as such the Trainers actually called us one by one to notify us of the cancellation. Then all my sessions got cancelled by NS portal. I rebooked. Then CB came. Then Mindef waived my window. My new window has just started. And as days pass by, my window is getting shorter. So yes, it is our responsibility to clear the window WITHIN the one year period.  Just like years ago, we have to clear 10sessions IPT and then 3 months for 8 RT. Our own responsibility is to clear the required sessions within the stipulated time frame."
"My situation is same as you, window close in 3rd week of July, I wrote in to Mindef and just received a letter that it will be waived off for current window."
Actually for this kind of situation it can be negotiate one. you can contact MINDEF hotline or your unit S8 for help.  A few years ago I also kenna charge letter for not attending IPPT/IPT due to some circumstances but with the help of my unit's DYS8 they gave me a chance and for the current situation it is even easier to get waiver for this cycle IMO as it is no one's fault to have this kind of situation happened. So don't need to worry so much as I don't think MINDEF is that ireasonable to punish people for things that they didn't do wrong.
"in current situation, yes its easier."
"Received a letter from NSAD today dated 20 May 2020 informing me that I am granted a one-time waiver for my annual IPPT requirement for my current window. By right, my window closes at late July 2020. Hope this information clears things up for some people."
Same I received my letter today. Window closes early july for me.
"Did you write in to them to ask for waiver ? Mine also closes end July, till now no letter from them yet."
"Hi, taking my ippt at Khatib camp soon, how's it? Any FR to share? TIA"
How soon ?
Can resume IPPT meh?
I did not.
Probably your unit do it for you.
"Call NS hotline. The letter may have gone missing thanks to Singpost. If IPPT window close late July, you should have received the waiver letter by now."
Received last Fri.
Same here. Received notice of waiver last Friday too.
can't book any ipt. Seems like only sept 1 and 2 can book only
"Only three dates 1,2,3 sept for IPPT. Wait for phase two for them to release."
Anyone with August birthdays received waivers for the window? I usually clear it via IPT. But it's becoming very likely I don't have enough time to do that given the situation.
Same here. My Birthday late august. Wondering if can get waiver. Do we need to write in to MINDEF ? or is there any hotline to call ?
How does the waiver for ippt work? Will they notify us?
For my case is sms notification followed by a mailer to registered address. Back in April.
Just receive letter for ippt annual waiver for this year .
I’m august bday just receive the waiver. You will receive a letter soon
Waiver till Aug this year
October birthday will there be waiver?
Will get one.  The army men probably deployed to do things covid related.
Depends on situation I suppose. But looking at current trend I think the chances are quite high.
My birthday in oct and they told me mine will be waived. I emailed them and asked and they told me that.
Oh? Recently just booked my sept IPPT
i tot aug then start?
"They released slots for September 1st onwards, SMS said that waiver was until 31st August Hope got waiver bah"
"hmmm open liao arh, then i go book 1st, i can only do on weekends sia, but i working on weekends 9am to 7pm  ok, booked all sundays  the slots of little, really must book 1st sia"
"I did 9 out of 10 session, my letter said waived for this year but when I go to NS Portal, it still say I need to clear my IPPT by end of this month..........."
Is there any announcement on ipt/rt for nsmen? The previous date I saw on ns.sg is 30 jun.  My window opened 3 months ago.......  Thanks!
"Can check NS portal, maybe inside will state."
I also logged into NS portal and it seems that ippt is resuming in Sep. But only show booking dates until Oct.  Does anyone know if ICT is also resuming during this period?
I have ICT on late October and so far there is no news of it being postponed.
My August ICT was cancelled.
So sian for IPPT
"Called ns hotline and was told my ippt requirement waived (bday in sept) and expected to receive notification about this frm my unit, so far haven't got notified by my unit though."
When can start ippt? During covid I buff myself up and should be able to finally pass my iPpt
From the NS portal it seems that we can book in Sep and Oct
"September bday and had live chat with NS portal and they said  Quote: MINDEF have temporarily suspended the conduct of IPPT, IPT and RT for SAF NSmen at FCCs, SAFRA gyms and IPT-in-the-Park till 31 Aug (inclusive). This suspension may be extended if the COVID-19 situation does not improve. Health Screening Programme (HSP) will also be deferred. Quote: As you are one of the NSmen affected by the closure, your current window will be waived. However, your NS portal will only be updated on the waiver once your current IPPT window closes. You will also be receiving the SMS and letter regards to the waiver nearing your window closing date (SMS). You will also be receiving the letter 3 weeks from either the time the SMS is sent, nearing the window closure or after your window close. And when asked about my IPPT booking which I have on 1st sept Quote: You may log in to cancel the IPPT session. Do check with them and share results"
I think all activity up to Aug bah...  Mine Nov ICT still on.....
Just booked ippt in September. Wanna clock my couple hundred $ :p
"Any pre enlistee trying to book ippt at kranji fcc for tmr?  I've been having so much trouble with the booking portal. (booked it, once I refresh or whatever, it'll say I haven't booked it....)  Any idea if I just head down tmr I can get my ippt done and any suggestion for timing to go down if so?"
Call NS Hotline. In normal times already cannot anyhow. During C19 so many places only accept appointments. What’s the chances of you being able to walk in??
I have no idea man.. I can wake up early to go and try. Never been to kranji fcc. Don't know what it's like. I'm a noob basically. I called ns hotline many times. Told me they escalate it and may get a call today or tmr morning.  Tmr is my last chance to book ippt (portal wasn't working for 3 weeks and I only had 1 month notice)
"It’s in an army camp, what makes you think you can just go in? When did you call them?"
Down for 3 weeks? Cannot be ah unless you only try on weekends.
A week back. Ah I see. Thanks for headsup
Nope. Tried everyday
You should have called earlier. I guess you just got to live with it lor
This year many ippt will be waived. We don't know the situation getting better or worse.
"Anyone knows if for example I'm enlisting on 12 Aug 2020 but managed to pass ippt before enlisting according to their protocol and stuff so no issue.  I was told I will get another enlistment date soon. So, 12 Aug + 8 weeks later is enlistment date?  Anyone knows or has experienced same thing?"
It can be the batch after if the upcoming enhanced batch is full
Thought resuming already
News have said that all IPPT/IPT/RT have been cancelled until 30 Sep.  I have a feeling that it is not impossible that everyone will have their current window waived.
If it drags till Dec maybe
can save money from not having to pay rank pay
Birthday early October and just received my IPPT waiver letter.
they can save ippt monetary rewards too
This year still have reservice?
If you got SAF100 sure
"ippt still got waived or not  how ppl going to run 2.4km , without having close proximity"

"did mindef sent u any msg indicating the waiver of your window? if yes, means waived. Otherwise, book the next avail IPPT and pass it."
"Slots seem to be blanked out through November when I checked a few hours ago. If by Dec still not opened, I confirm won't be able to clear before bday in mid-Jan. Shall see if there is waiver by then."

"Latest Update : IPPT, ICT to resume progressively from October; NSmen returning for training will get tested for Covid-19  SINGAPORE - Individual physical proficiency tests (IPPT) and in-camp training (ICT) for operationally-ready national servicemen (NSmen) will resume progressively from October, said the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) on Thursday (Sept 3).

Eh what time you received the sms?
8.16pm  Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
"In view of the waiver of IPPT/RT requirements, will I lose my opportunity to achieve my IPPT incentive? No, NSmen who are eligible for the waiver can still attempt IPPT, and qualify for incentives, should they do so before their IPPT window closes."
But not clear about whether if fail need RT right?
You better get black and white from official channel about whether need to do RT if fail. People here can’t be held responsible
Ya loh later attempt liao fail then suay suay rt  Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
"Yeah same, my ICT is in Dec 2020, should be cancelled too! but next year need to wait for the call up again"
received sms that rt waived.
Anyone knows if attempting IPPT counts as ORNS activity for income tax relief? Or is it counted only if I pass it or attend at least a certain number of times for IPT/IPPT?
"My current ippt window is closing on 9 Dec 2020, already had it cleared on 18 Jan 2020. Yesterday, i received an sms as follows -  ""Dear NSman, as your IPPT/RT window is affected by the current COVID-19 situation, you have been granted a one-time waiver of your annual IPPT/RT requirement. You will receive a letter by end Sep 20. Should you still wish to attempt the IPPT, you may do so before your IPPT window closes. Thank you.""  To be clear, what does the one-time waiver actually mean?"
"If your window closes on or before Feb 7, 2021, and you can’t clear it, you don’t have to clear lor. But since you have already cleared, them this wouldn’t affect you."
I booked 10 sessions IPT in October.  All IPT sessions cancelled except the first session IPPT.  So now I am very confused. Should I still go clock the first session or not?
No need to go if ur window closing on or before 07.02.2021. Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
Same thing happened to me! Also considering whether to go down or not. Also thinking whether it's an error that the first session isn't cancelled.
It should be waived. Call them to confirm to get peace of mind..  Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
"it's closing in June 2021. But I not sure of the situation now. If i cant book sessions on time or no slots, then I'm GG next year."
so u still got time lor
Same for me too
I can't book any IPT slots.  Sent from . using GAGT
Only Ippt and IPT IPPT sessions are allowed from 1 Oct. RT and IPT are still banned.

window close before feb next year?
How to book IPT IPPT?  They don't allow me to book IPPT in the IPT section.  I only can book in the IPPT section  Sent from . using GAGT
In this case then those who need to attend IPT to fulfil their IPPT requirements might not have sufficient time to complete all 10 sessions especially those whose windows ended shortly after 7 Feb.  Seriously I think MINDEF should grant waiver to everyone as it is not that fair for those whose windows ended shortly after 7 Feb since most others would have their current windows waived due to COvid-19.
Not yet grant doesn’t mean wouldn’t grant
The whole IPT is blocked off. Only those that had existing IPT IPPT can still proceed as scheduled. But subsequent ippt are all cancelled
Only for this current window right?
I see Bro wabbit92...  Sent from . using GAGT
Yup the exact same thing happening to me.  1st session IPT-IPPT in Oct not cancelled (booked in Aug I think) My 8 other IPT in the park in Oct all cancelled.  Now wondering should I just go for that one session then see how it goes for the remaining 9 unbooked sessions.
"My window closes March 2021 sia. Then have to chiong once IPT can be booked? Hope there will be extended waiver, not fair sia. Then again since when NS is ever fair..."
Hmm this i not so sure leh...i go ippt  Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
"Same for me too. But i think you should. Even if can clear one, will count as you done this year requirement no matter what"
I also hope there will be an extended waiver as my windows will close just a couple of days after 7 February next year and I am those type who needs to attend IPT in order to fulfil the requirements.  Also because of Covid-19 majority of them would have already granted waiver except for those who windows closes on next year mid-late Feb and early March I suppose and it is indeed quite unfair for us especially when have only this few months instead of the usual 12 months to clear our IPT/RT.  Or at the very least they should just 'pro-rated' our requirement to fulfil.. Like instead of attending 10 IPT sessions we only required to attend 1-3 sessions in this window.
They expect you to clear IPT from Oct Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
+1 on this!!
nov reservist got cancel?
you received notification?
ICT resume from Oct onwards. If you nv receive notification means still have  Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
IPT/RT is still being postponed. They are only resuming IPPT
my HSP FFI has lapsed but my unit never book new FFI session for me so technically i am exempted from taking it for time being?
"there is such a thing called ""contact your unit""."
Technically you are taking the risk also.
"under SAF directive if you are not undergo the HSP you are not allowed to take ippt  i think due to covid there are alot of backlog of nsmen unable to go for HSP, those nsmen should act blur and wait for things to happen"
Ignorance isn’t always bliss. You can try that. But if you kena then you just got to face the consequences.

I also received sms. But unit still tell me take IPPT wor
Same same. Received sms also
how they tell u?
Maybe I phrase it in a wrong way. They say in their record I haven't took IPPT. But they got no record saying my IPPT have been waived. See how thing goes ba
received sms that next yr ippt is waived too because cant do HSP this yr. so 2 yr ippt waived.
wait when did u guys receive the sms. my birthday was in july. is it they send by batches?
"“ All SAF NSmen whose IPPT windows close on or before Feb 7, 2021 will be granted a one-time waiver, said the ministry, adding that those affected will be informed individually via SMS and a letter in September.”  You will have enough time to clear it by July next year ma."
"I received this sms saying:  ""(Fr: MINDEF) Dear NSman, your HSP appointment has been deferred due to the current COVID-19 situation. You will be given a one-time waiver of your IPPT window ending Year 2021 as you will not have a valid HSP certificate to take your IPPT. You will receive a waiver letter by end Sep 2020. Thank you.""   What do they actually mean by HSP?"
"Health Screening Programme (HSP) If you are 35 years old and above, you need to undergo the SAF Health Screening Programme (HSP). As a safety precaution, only those with a Low Cardiac Risk Outcome will be allowed to participate and be certified Fit for Instruction (FFI). https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...ning-programme"
"meaning for active reservist personnel once u reach 35, need to clear FFI before u are even allowed to attempt IPPT"
Those with the HSP sms means ippt waived for 2 year instead of 1.
"So from the sms, i do not have to do anything?"
ICT and E1 Pep all not starting  this windows very very hard to clear...
i believe the SMS is already very clear.
maybe he cannot understand English
Jialat. Then in that case just suffer consequences lor
"For those who were asking. I’ve emailed Ns.sg and was told the following:  Kindly take note that MINDEF will be reopening FCCs for IPPT from 1 October 2020, in line with the effort to gradually resume more NS activities safely. SAF and HT NSmen will be able to book their IPPTs at the FCCs.  Hence, only IPPT will resume at FCCs. There are no IPT/E1PEP/IPT in the Park/RT bookings allowed until further notice. We appreciate your kind understanding."
Like that will be very difficult for those in the RT and IPT whom window close shortly after 7 Feb 2021 to fulfil their requirement. Think I might email MINDEF or enquire with my unit's S8 when I go for my reservist next month. Hopefully they will grant waiver of some sort.

"I have a window that closes after the February cut-off, but on the NS portal my IPPT due date is now 2022.  No form of letter or SMS though."
My IPPT due date is still 2021 despite my windows also closed shortly after the cut off date. Shall continue to monitor.
Mine just open on 4th Oct..
"Question, i also received this sms notice but i have not reached 35 yo. am i still still eligible to take ippt without HSP?"

I received the waiver letter. Like that can wavie for this year window liao ah?
When is your bdae?
"letter already stated whether waived for this window or not leh. if u are unsure, just go and clear your current window"
No Ipt in the park even in Feb =( SAF will see a lot of defaulters next year as many will not be able to pass / complete their IPT cycles.
I got the exemption from IPPT through SMS and got letter but I see my NS portal. still got the haven't book IPPT message. funny thing is. No slot to book. how to fulfill sia
Your black and white more important.
"in fact if exempted and you haven't booked any sessions in your current window still means you ""haven't book IPPT"".  system is normal what  this is then funny."
"They should put ""exempted"" instead of ""not yet taken"" to avoid confusion"
"i don't see why is it binary.  you can be exempted, but doesn't mean you can't take it if you want the incentive."
Feb no more slots liao  Sent from . using GAGT
Why Feb so early no slots?  Sent from . using GAGT
Think all rush to book probably
"this will be another html or javascript website that needs reconfiguration. There are tonnes of codes to amend and furthermore this exmption period is only temporary. Pls understand this is Mindef/SAF.  If you still have this burning confusion in your heart, do write in to their quality management."
Next year RT will be bad. Many who can't clear IPT have to go RT and the slots will be limited too. I can see many defaulters.
If they didn’t realise this will be a problem then sure will have outrage
So far still no news on when IPT/RT will resume and how is the arrangement for those who need to take IPT/RT with windows closing shortly after the 7 Feb cut off date.
"Government being passive as usual, everybody can see that there will be a huge problem with people all going to chiong for slot bookings once IPT and RT resumes, hopefully those at Mindef realise it as well and will announce the measures that they will take to mitigate these issues, but I’m not optimistic."
I did be surprised if they don’t realise it’s an issue when there are so many people who will default through no fault of theirs
my window closes 28 March (slightly more than 1 month from announced Feb cut off) Still can't book any IPT. No slots available till end Feb.  how?
"Aiya don't need think so much. Most likely ippt and rt requirement will be waived again.  Covid-19 is so infectious that when an infected person drink from a cup, the cup will still be infectious even after 10 days with normal washing (need to wash with alcohol or heat the cup at high temp)  Physical activities so many sweats and water vapour will sure spread Covid-19 like wildfire. Govt cannot take the risk."
"just to check. if nv go for FFI, will they call u up for ICT? or wait until u clear FFI den call u back for ICT?"
I believe they should have a reasonable plan for us who needs to clear IPT/RT and with windows closing shortly after 7 Feb 2020 but then they should be more proactive enough to communicate with us. I don't believe they do not forsee such issues.  If I am still required to fulfil my IPPT requirements for my current window under such circumstances I will definitely feedback to my unit S8 and MINDEF as it will be too unreasonable.
if never clear HSP FFI you are not allow to do PT and etc
"If I am not wrong, your unit wants to call you for ICT, they will just call.  It becomes your responsibility to make sure you clear your FFI too."
"your unit is suppose to arrange for HSP FFI, not you because they need to issue u SAF100"
Oh ya.  Means ur unit can call you up anytime for ict together with hsp ffi
okie tks! so means they can call me up for ICT even thou i haven go for FFI.  Just that i cant take IPPT right?
you need to clear HSP before they call u up for ict
If I'm not wrong this is not the case. HSP is only needed for IPPT.  ICT can still be called without HSP.
"https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/ippt-ipt-rt/ippt/health-and-medical/health-screening-programme If you are 35 years old and above, you need to undergo the SAF Health Screening Programme (HSP). As a safety precaution, only those with a Low Cardiac Risk Outcome will be allowed to participate and be certified Fit for Instruction (FFI). Similarly, if you have been certified unfit or temporarily unfit for IPPT, you will also not be allowed to participate in IPPT Preparatory Training (IPT) and Remedial Training (RT) for the same duration. by right you are not allow to take part in any type of physical activities like SOC or other PT if you not clear HSP"
"Yes, other physical activities too as u mentioned. But call up ict by itself doesn't need the hsp to be done, cos typically on the first day of ict the commander will call out those that need to do hsp and send them to the MO. These men typically will not join in strenuous activity. If things have changed liao then I dunno."
"For Medical centre to conduct HSP need more specialize equipment like ECG machine. Also your blood sample needs to sent for testing in labs.  Not many Medical centre can do HSP.  In your case its actually your unit's S1 admin lapse to sent NSmen for HSP during ICT, by right NSmen should only be called up if they have cleared HSP."
What kiwi said should be the norm.  They will just call you for Ict or ict briefing. Then those who need hsp will be given a date to go for hsp.
not very efficiency way of doing things. 3G army doing 1G things.
"I think the commander is more concerned with getting most of his cohort to finish all the cycles together so that very few will still need to either join another unit or do makeup ICTs to finish the cycle. If there is the requirement of completed HSP in order to qualify for ICT callup this will just make things worse by having more of such men. So far I dun think there is the directive that binds the ICT callup to HSP, cos I think neither the commanders nor the men like it. For the commanders, it doesn't matter to call up a man whose HSP is not done yet, cos during the course of the ICT there is still the need for a pool of Attend B personnel for the usual fatigue party for menial work."
"In SAF its always if nothing happens then everything is fine. wait till one day some accident happens where a NSman not cleared of HSP go to PT, collapsed and died. Its very vague relationship between HSP and ICT. In private sector or even when you want to sign on, you will need to undergo medical screening and cleared before you can join."
U dun have to worry about it. Servicemen not cleared HSP are compelled to join PT or other strenuous activity. They will just be treated as Attend B personnel.
"Kena called for IPPT next month, shag.."
They scheduled an IPPT time slot for you???
haha why u so vip? they allocate a slot for IPPT just for u?
"how come u got call up for IPPT, now IPPT should be all booked by yourself"
ICT or IPPT? 傻傻分不清楚
"Afternoon to fellow bros here.  I got 1 question cause i didn't do IPT before so need some small advice.  The system only appear ""IPPT"" icon in my screen so does that mean once i do the IPPT (1st session) then the system will ALLOW/SHOW you to book IPT, am i right ?  Another 2 question  is the IPT conduct @ (park/FCC) resume already ? Is it hard to clear the push up station using the machine ?  Thank a lot"
"You have to select 'Access E Services' on the IPPT section of the ns.sg main page and from there select 'Book IPT'. When you book IPT, it will automatically convert your 1st and 10th IPT sessions into IPT-IPPT shortly after you booked your IPT sessions so there is no need to book a IPPT session specifically as your 1st and 10th IPT session is already IPPT. Also, all IPT and RT have not resumed yet."
Thank man !  Sian. I press the IPT-IPPT and totally cannot book.  All unavailable date. Think i need to ask my officer for help liao since you guys mention IPT/RT haven't' resume ....  Windows close on 27/Feb
I managed to book ipt for Feb though. Is not available or the slots are full?
"My one is still unable to book IPT for this month, next month and Feb 2021 though.   Greent wrote: Thank man !  Sian. I press the IPT-IPPT and totally cannot book.  All unavailable date.

"Dec/Jan/Feb all showing ""Unavailable Date"" for IPT.  If i press IPPT, i can select a few dates but not IPT.  Really buay gum lor, those after 7/2 one all eat ""si mao"" for RT. They should wave off all 2020 slots than handful.  37 yrs old still need to do this IPPT. Jin sian."
"You aren’t the only one facing the same issue ma. See what they say lor. If people can’t take IPT or IPPT cause they have limited slots, then can’t blame the person ma"
Jin funny right !! lol.  Why they never realize this small move will eventually become a major problem.
did they say they never or haven't?
I believe the peeps at MINDEF are reasonable people and they should have a reasonable plan for us. However I feel that there is a lack of communication from them. When they announced the resumption of IPPT they did not address the issues that those on IPT/RT whom window ends shortly after 7 Feb 2021 will face.. Especially when IPT/RT have not resumed.
"HTML Code: I believe the peeps at MINDEF are reasonable people and they should have a reasonable plan for us.  However I feel that there is a lack of communication from them. When they announced the resumption of IPPT they did not address the issues that those on IPT/RT whom window ends shortly after 7 Feb 2021 will face.. Especially when IPT/RT have not resumed. Yes. I totally agreed with your points as they only resume IPPT test but didn't inform their next move for the IPT/RT ppls which lead to confusion. Well, the only thing can do now is email to unit, ask OC for advice while trying to clear IPPT if can."
"I feels that back then they might have overlooked the fact that there are many who are in RT window or need to take IPT whose windows ends shortly after 7 Feb 2021 and the fact that they will have problems to fulfil their RT/IPT requirements in such a short time flame especially when IPT/RT have not resumed together with IPPT and is still suspended until now. Hopefully they are now aware of this. But then I think there is a good chance that they might give us some waiver or extension or some sort especially when it is not our fault to begin with. Even if they did not say anything, we can still feedback to our unit's S8/DYS8 to seek for help. I have once seeked help from my unit's DYS8 for help in some IPPT matters and was waived the charges. And for this case we have a very strong reason to 'fight' on. But anyway let's see what they will say when they resumed IPT/RT."
I don't think it is available for booking also. Yesterday morning I logged in to ns.sg and all slots for Dec/Jan/Feb are unavailable and it is quite impossible that there is no even one slot available if it is available for booking.
"When they come up with the date, they will definitely know who will be impacted and who aren’t if not they wouldn’t be able to send out the notification. As much as there’s a lot of negative views about MINDEF/SAF, I don’t think that are that incompetent to not realise people whose window will close the day after their “arbitrary” will not be impacted if they are still suspending the activities and people cannot book. I reckon it’s more like they don’t want to announce anything until they have a clearer picture of what’s going on with the virus. Who knows further waiver? Or an extended period to clear. Don’t worry about the wrong thing."
IPT/RT should be suspended till next year

Funny... how come you are able to book? My one still cannot book even for Feb 2021.... By right MINDEF will officially annouance when IPT/RT will be resume and available for booking.... BTW when is your window closing?
23rd July. I managed to book 3 slots before cannot book. Sent from . using GAGT
"My window is closing on 18 Feb. I am now wondering if they are blocking the bookings of those whose windows ends shortly after Feb 7 2021 (i.e mid-end Feb, March etc) instead. Because if they are resuming the bookings on 1 Dec 0000 hours (somemore without officially annouancing so most ppl might not know) it can't be all slots have been booked when I logged in at around 8am on 1 Dec."

Actually why don’t write an email to NS contact centre. Put down your scenario. Get a b&w reply on how they will address your predicament when it’s no fault of yours if you can’t book.
"I wrote in to MINDEF to get a b&w response.  ""MINDEF will be reopening FCCs for IPPT from 1 October 2020, in line with the effort to gradually resume more NS activities safely. SAF and HT NSmen will be able to book their IPPTs at the FCCs. HSPs will also resume from 1 Oct 20. However kindly be informed that IPT and RT sessions are suspended till further notice.

I managed to book 1day for Feb too. Ipt ippt. But may not be able to go as I am busy with work and the slot is on a weekday.
"Just logged in to check, cannot book any IPT/ RT sessions till early march. All blocked out."
"For those who say cannot book. I doubt is cannot book. But rather, it’s full. No reason for us to troll you."
"If full, i don't think ext 2 months is enough for all NSmen to clear.  I'm sincerely hoping they looking at this issue right now and i still waiting for my unit to response to me."
no need to he sincere about it. If there is not enough supply. then is not your fault no? get a B&W to cover yourself
Don't worry la. You see army pattern you know they will extend to 2 years window to clear future ipt rt due to pandemic.

Yes. Half day rank pay.  Sent from . using GAGT
Just go 1 time better than you do nothing cause from oct till (your window) since they wave till 1 week of feb which is more than enough to attend at least once.

"REMINDER: INDIVIDUAL PHYSICAL PROFICIENCY TEST (IPPT)   1. NSmen whose IPPT windows are closing between 8 Feb 21 and 31 Mar 21 are required to attempt their IPPT.  2. Our records indicate that you have yet to attempt your IPPT for your current window which will close on 28/3/2021. You may book your IPPT through the NS Portal (www.ns.sg) or via the NS Hotline at 1800-eNSNSNS (1800-3676767).  3. You may attempt your IPPT at the following Fitness and Conditioning Centres (FCC) and SAFRA EnergyOne gyms:  a. FCC: Khatib, Maju, Bedok and Kranji  b. SAFRA: Tampines, Jurong, Punggol and Toa Payoh (There are no incentive awards for IPPT attempted at the SAFRA EnergyOne gyms.)  4. When an NSman fails to take his IPPT before his IPPT window closes, he becomes an IPPT defaulter. Disciplinary actions will be taken against him for failing to attempt IPPT.  5. To minimise any inconvenience to yourself, please attempt your IPPT before your IPPT window closes.  6. For clarifications, you may contact APGC NS Branch at 6304 5583.  7. We look forward to your continued contribution and commitment to National Service."
"Just need to book one ippt because for IPT, only the first and last session can be IPPT. But if you really want to go for more IPPT, the first 3 IPPT sessions will be payable for attendance. You can keep attending IPPTs until you get your desired Gold/Silver/Pass w incentive."
It sounds like to me for those whose windows close between the above stated date as long as you have attempted IPPT it is considered as fulfilled requirements regardless of the result. But anyway we shall see what is their official stance with regards of this.
"Aiya .. till now still unable to select any slot for IPT so forget it liao. My ah sir say you go and attend 1 time first and the rest will see wat S8 said.  If can pass, gd la. If fail bo bian lor."

"Sorry for a stupid question but still need to clarify. PS  Within a month, how many IPT can be book ?"
"You can only book a slot every other day, so essentially you can finish the whole programme (10 sessions) within a single month."
"Phase 3 starting in 2 more weeks, hopefully they will give an update about IPT bookings soon..."
how about NS who is 35 and above whom did not undergo HSP?
"Thank you for the inform bro.  HSP only cover you up to 9 month before you go another round. If you didn't go, you cannot take IPPT."
"Hi, I just got one question want to ask.  The IPT, is it once complete all the IPT sessions, even if throughout the process never pass IPPT, a NS men is considered to have cleared the IPPT requirement, and won't have to do RT in the next IPPT window?  Just a Yes / No answer will do.  Thanks."
Yes
Yes. IPT again in the next window. You can clear IPT without passing IPPT all the way until MR
Can we wear a running pouch during the ippt run? Thinking of just bringing along a mobile phone and wallet only  Posted from PCWX using Rem mm is best waifu

There are lockers to put ur belongings. You cant run with them. Anyway why with burden also Posted from PCWX using SM-G973F
thanks was thinking dun wanna use the limited amt of lockers and also dun wanna bring bags just to store stuff
Actually those FCCs have enough lockers but majority of it cannot be locked.
Break News  My OC just sms me that IPT in FCC and IN the PArk will be resume on 04/1/21.  BOOKING starting ON 28/12/2020  Good luck bro.
Ok noted MRed alrdy lor!
I would like to see if there is any 'special arrangements' for those whose windows close shortly after 7 Feb. Yes it is possible to complete all 10 sessions in 'perfect scenario' but many of us still have our civilian committment to fulfill...
https://www.facebook.com/mindefsg/ph...7323757861059/
"The SAF is currently reviewing our NS IPPT System, and will release details of the review when ready.  this part most important"
Just now I called in to NS hotline and the call center personnel told me that IPT/RT is still suspended until further notice despite MINDEF putting up this post some 4 hours ago.
I do hope they are aware that it will be quite difficult for those whose windows close shortly after 7 Feb to fulfil their IPT requirements as mentioned in one of the comments in that facebook post. If worst come to worst I will just complete a few sessions of IPT and go for RT in the next window.
Maybe haven’t get memo
Just called the NS hotline again and the CS personnel said that I should just attend as many IPT sessions as possible and call them back if cannot complete all the 10 sessions.  If they have resumed IPT together with IPPT in Oct then it will be possible to clear all 10 sessions but now they only resume IPT on January and it seems like they have overlooked those IPT takers whose windows close shortly after 7 Feb. Now no choice lor see how many IPT sessions I can attend but to clear all 10 sessions within 1.5 months will be very difficult considering we have our civilian commitments to fulfil also.
I think CS just giving templated reply now.
Just attend whatever you can from now.  Just wait and see lor. Bo bian liao.
"Need some advice as I get different answer from everyone I asked,  E.g Birth date 1 Dec and MR date is 10 May 2021. Do I have to take IPPT for year 2022?  I heard it's based of SAF Financial year which is April. I called NS hotline a guy told me that as long I attempt a IPPT session even if I fail they will allow me to MR is this true?  cause I'm unable to find any guideline on this"

Sound like your window is shortly after 7 Feb (just like mine). You didn't receive the e-mail I got? Sounds like we just need to attempt IPPT and that's it.
Yup my windows will close on 18 Feb. However I did not receive the email.  It is logical that for our case we only need to attend IPPT but anyway let's see what MINDEF/SAF will say officially.
"U 18th , i 28th.  Anyway, they wana introduce the workout @ home for NSmen (just like those NSF) and wondering will this become an alt way for IPT or RT *lol*"
"for those who wanna book IPPT, better book early.  my window is closing in March next year and the earliest Sat slot is already 27 Feb. got weekday slots of cos but weekdays not feasible for most due to work."
Tomorrow resume IPT/RT liao.  Hope everyone can clear as much as possible.
"Funny, today is 28th and still no IPT slots are available.  All slots are taken up within 9 hours or they still haven't open for booking yet?"
"Don't know what's going on, just today 12am I fast hand fast leg login to NS portal to try and book, also didn't have any slots at all..."
1pm  according to facebook annoucement
Finally can make bookings but the slots is limited... No IPTs on all Tues and Thurs also and IPT-IPPT is only available on Sat/Sun as Mon no IPT-IPPT conducted.  Also till now still not sure how are they going to deal with those whose windows closed shortly after 7 Feb... I don't know if they are going to solve the issue on case by case basis?
"I don't know what else to suggest other than calling NS hotline, or messaging Mindef on Facebook privately...but just attend as many sessions as you can first. At worst just do 20 RT sessions next window, but it's better than being a defaulter."
"If they didn’t realise the number of people that will be affected, then they really cmi."
"I can at most book only 3 sessions before my window close considering my civilian commitments.  Even if I can 'squeeze' to fit all possible schedule at most I can only hit 8 sessions.  reddevil0728 wrote: If they didn’t realise the number of people that will be affected, then they really cmi. Some people have been feedback this issue on their FB post but still there is still no direction given from MINDEF except to ask us to call NS hotline (in which they don't have a solution also) or sending the private message to those who commented on their posts.  I think it is more on the lack of communication from MINDEF than them not aware of this issue."
Yep. Probably. They should have at least release a holding reply to say that they are looking into the various concerns.
I got question since i first time doing IPT.  They mention 1st and 10th is your IPPT so can i book all 10 slot on the spot but my IPPT is on 16th but my IPT is on 4th  Can that be done ?  Thank
"For your 1st and 10th sessions you have to book for a IPT slot where there is IPT-IPPT. i.e The slot does not indicate 'No IPPT'. And for the current condition, only the Sat and Sun sessions got IPT-IPPT."
"That mean SAT/SUN, there're still be IPT session training going on la but just that those want to take the IPT-IPPT have to book only sat/sun right ?  Like that si bei squeeze man."
Yup as there is no Tues/Wed/Thurs sessions and thus if need to take IPT-IPPT have to book a weekend slot as they don't conduct IPT-IPPT on Mondays and FCCs are closed on Friday.
The sessions are very very very limited. Sat and sun only 930am  Mon totally no ippt conducted.
"Just what I saw: Normal ippt will be conducted on Tues, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday on this timing: Weekday IPPT: 5pm, 7pm Weekend: 7:30am, 5pm, 7pm RT/IPT folk only can opt for Sat and Sunday IPPT (1st, 8th, ippt) on this timing: Weekend: 9:30am RT/IPT folk can only attend non IPPT RT/IPT session on Sat/Sun and Monday: Monday non IPPT RT/IPT session: 5pm, 7pm Weekend non IPPT RT/IPT session: 9:30am"
Wah piang eh I PM-ed MINDEF fb and the reply they gave me is to book all 10 IPTs as early as possible and consider IPT In The Park.  WTF sial I live and work in Jurong and all the IPT In The Park venues are inconvenient to me. Furthermore the main issue is having a short period to clear all 10 IPTs and it had nothing to do with venues. Even if they had more slots like pre-COVID I would be unable to complete all 10 IPTs either with such a short timeframe.  I think I have to prepare to go RT for next window liao but before that I will seek help from my unit since it is not my fault for not being able to fulfil the IPT requirement.
Rt is 20 sessions over 2 years. Ipt is 10 sessions per year. Same la
that's not very fair tbh. Is MINDEF FB reply considered an official reply from MINDEF or just some NSF clerk replying to shut NSmen up?

"Just try go for as many ipt as you can. If really can't clear in time, can try approach fitness instructor n ask to see their chief fitness instructor on duty to highlight ur problem. In the past, they usually arrange for the windows to be extended by one or two months after ur birthday. Worst come to come, really have to go get but you don't have to do the full 20 session."
Normally is  Year 1 Fail IPPT  Year 2 Do RT 20 session  Year 3 Fail IPPT  Year 4 Do RT 20 session   For IPT is  Year 1-4 Do 10 session per year  So in total is all 40 sessions for 4 years in the example
"Ya ok, I understand already, but clear RT more shag because you have to plan up to 20 sessions within a year. IPT at least plan 10 a year still ok."

actually why so worried about it if it is like a logical thing that you aren't alone?
Manage to squeeze in 9 IPT session and left 1 session (IPT-IPPT) which later i going to ask my OC for help.  I don't know what're they thinking but just want to hit SOP. Haizz ....
Should reduce the number of IPT and RT sessions permanently. Maybe 8 and 16 respectively.
go and be Mindef minister then u can change whatever lockstock stuff tt u want  Song Bo?
I think can contact the unit S8/DYS8 to see whether can request for reversal from RT to IPPT/IPT for the next window if cannot complete all 10 sessions if there is still no official stance from MINDEF with regards to our cases. reddevil0728 wrote: actually why so worried about it if it is like a logical thing that you aren't alone?

"Hi all, I booked my first ipt session at khatib and understand that the system should auto change the session name to ipt-ippt right? When I booked it, I already made sure that that session does not have the "" NO IPPT"" indication.  But its been 2 days and the system is still showing it as ""IPT"" so just wondering if this is normal or they will update it nearer to the session itself. Thanks!"
My one is also the same. By right a day or two after your booking the system will change your 1st and 10th session from IPT to IPT-IPPT.

"By right they should have aware of this issue but until now there is still no official stances from them with regards of it. Actually a few years ago I did have my charges waived after seeking the help of my unit's DYS8 so for this case I believe that as long as we have put in some efforts to attend a few sessions we should stand some chances to have our next window reverting back to IPT/IPPT or at the very least, extension of window."
Actually you can see that there are issues with their planning also.  I believe that for most of us we are yet to attend the 1st session which should be IPT-IPPT after such a long closure yet their very first session on 4 Jan is without IPT-IPPT. Then there is no IPT conducted on 5-8 Jan in the FCC (Only IPT-In-The-Park but no IPPT conducted also) so for most of us we can only start our 1st sessions on 9 Jan which is the first sessions to have IPT-IPPT.

Still don't see why you are so stress over something that is beyond your control? Can you imagine, you are already so diligent and facing this problem. How about those that dgaf kind? They all get charged? no right? You probably top quartile at trying to be best effort already. You should chill and stop worrying over something that is beyond your control. As long as you can show proof that you have done what you can, there will probably be long queues of people ahead of you to be charged."
"My windows closes end May.  All I can say is, just attend what you can now and stop worrying about what’s next to come for next window first. This is beyond your control.  Just don’t get charged. At most next window a few more sessions. This is the best solution right now. No point overthinking on your side because no matter how much you think, you’ll just make yourself frustrated but nothing will be change.  Btw how do we even contact our unit dys8? I only got my OC contact."
"Yup. No need to overstress yourself since is not your ""tai chi"" only.  Just do whatever sessions you can and let your OC know you facing this issue so he can contact S8 for help. Please do it early so they have enough time to do the admin work.   Usually contact yr OC and he will do the rest for you. Also keep the sms incase any cock up during the communication."
"If have difficult issues on NS , can approach your unit's S8/ National Service Relations Officer(NSRO) .

"btw, anyone got ippt waived off?  my birthday is in june but no waiver, but yet those birthday in october got waived..how come?"
Jun 2021? Call hotline... maybe they missed u out. Or maybe u do not need to do IPPT in the first place
"yup, they ask me to finish it before june 2021"
"Oh no GG. My window close on 11 Feb and total left 4 slot available and its all on Monday. Wana chiong also cannot, system dont allow me to book since 1st session is suppose to be IPPT and no IPPT conduct on Mon"
Just book as many as you can while in the mean time contact OC/S8 for this unique situation right now.  Nobody can blame u not able to completed but can fault you if you don't book at least 1 IPPT.  Tomorrow kick off ...
haha no choice cant clear 10 ipt session liao. Just book 1 ippt to attempt first
"U still can clear if they ext the deadline period for your case.  If you have your OC/S8 number, you just sms them now so that tomorrow all back to office can start doing the handling work ....  Just my 2 cents advice."

Yep. That’s why I dunno why you continue to stress over something beyond your control. How you know they not addressing it publicly?
"hi i am above 35 and requires me to pass FFI first. however i am unable to book FFI due to medical centre close for NSman (was told). i tried to book FFI on the NS.SG health portal and it was rejected. no SAF100 was received.  my bday is in July. understand IPPT is waived for 1 year, any body got such prob here?"
It would be better if we have a clear direction from MINDEF... Actually if they want to address the issue they would have do so when they announced the resumption of IPT 2 weeks back. But anyway we shall see how things goes...
"Of course that would be the most ideal. But they aren’t or at least not yet. So why stress yourself? If they don’t realise that it is beyond people control and still charge people, I reckon you will be at the end of the line waiting to be charged given that you have really done what you can. I am pretty sure a lot of others didn’t even put in as much effort as you to resolve this. I think you really need to take a chill pill. 2020 is already a stressful yet. Don’t start 2021 with another stress that is beyond your control."
"Still the same for me, not updated. As long as we hold onto the black & white letter from them, will be fine la."
yours got waived? what is your window closing date?
"Bro, i think you better call your unit for this issue cause i did my FFI in December 2020 for 2021 period."
"Don't stress yourself la. No point as 2020 really a roller coaster for everyone esp those jobless LL need to do this IPPT and scarified their income .... As your previous question, you should contact your S8/OC now than later as give them time to do review the case etc ...."
Still no news..
"if i want to take IPT, first session must book IPPT, right?  cause i want to book IPT straight away, they don't allow me to. Not sure did I do the steps wrongly or what"

By the way. The way I see it. The slot a lot are gone. So be prepared. I wanted to shift my upcoming ippt on sun to next week and ipt in the park also no more already.
Wa maju? I wan haha
Think 99% slot all gone esp those 1st session must be IPT-IPPT.
"Yeah I know, had to book IPPT, even if I want IPT-IPPT. No choice. Well, fail and wait for waiver liao."
Anyone attended any ipt ippt sessions at Khatib fcc so far? Want to see how is the conduct and time needed there. I got commitments on Sunday but that is the only session available so it’s gonna be rush for me.  My main objective is to attempt the ippt and trigger IPT.
"If you take a look in that MINDEF fb posts, many people have feedback that they are unable to book any IPT-IPPT sessions and not much slots are available except those on Mondays.  At least I am still able to book a IPT-IPPT session and I also plan to take IPT-IPPT and trigger IPT."
isn't that good. further confirmation that you you aren't alone and don't need to stress
"wah shag balls, the earliest slot is march sia lol"

Huh how come saturday 0930 cannot do ipt-ippt? The booking system doesnt indicate sat 0930 as “No ippt” leh
"Maybe different camps different timing.  Go khatib, kranji and Maju la."
"I tried to book last year october or somthing and the options are still grey out. Now came back to see see slots and see only left one weekend, my birthday is on the February.  WTF."
wanna book ipt but the earliest slot that can do ippt is in april for maju camp. my window closes in May. got chance get waiver? haha
"Must go at least once. If not, you get court order and must appear in court and pay fine plus take 20 rt next year."
"Just book one ippt, fail, do rt, I can say that lots of guys will do RT this year because ipt hard to book now, unless mindef decides to give waiver as they see too many people doing RT when they want to finally open up RT."
Tomorrow my IPT-IPPT so hopefully can pass and sleep well (38 liao)  The problem can be solve is by cut down few session for IPT/RT personal so is easier for everyone to CLEAR the **** ASAP but they scare exc plan A then BCD got issue so we guys suffer together for nothing ....  Now is waiting game between us and mindef and with the COVI19 slowly climbing back i don't know wat next is their plan now.
"I went to Khatib FCC this morning, just finished my first IPT session. For now, first and last session no IPPT, just normal IPT training.  So I don’t know what the situation will be like also, is it just do 10 IPT considered clear IPPT requirements liao since don’t even have IPT-IPPT to do. Guess will have to wait for updates."

why your quote so strange 1?

If so then those 1st timers really xxxx because system lock   A quick question to all the bros here ....  I'm already done my 2021 HSP last yr December and didn't receive any letter etc so i can just go without tomorrow beside bring IC etc  Thank a lot
"Jia lat. Window closes in June, but only can book 1st IPT-IPPT session in Apr."
"Just came back for Bedok FCC and i ask some question after the instructor explain why SAT/SUN no IPPT etc.  Hopefully the following answers can help some of you here and still good to ask them if any doubt cause i may heard wrongly.  Q: Why SAT/SUN no IPT-IPPT ? A: The reason is HQ realize that the session start at 9.30am so by then finish about 10am+ and weather is going to be warm for 2.4km test.  Q: Is this apply to all FCC on no IPT-IPPT A: Yes. ALL FCC will not conduct IPT-IPPT on SAT/SUN  Q: Today mean we attend 1 training session right ? A: Yes. Today consider you attend 1 IPT session  Q: So how are we going to clear the windows ? A: Our OC is going to HQ this tuesday to find out what is the solution for this impact that those unable to book all session so please check your NS portal on tuesday to find out more.  Q: That's mean i still need to attend 10 IPT session la ? A: Right now the current planning is you need to HAVE AT LEAST 9 session of IPT (training) and 1 IPPT to clear your current windows.  Q: Those unable to book a single IPPT session but can book 10 IPT how ? A: It's still consider you clear your windows.  Q: Those cannot book 10 IPT how ? A: You need to book AT LEAST A IPPT session to void as defaulter.  Unknown part  *He didn't answer my question what if you book 5 IPT +1 IPPT but fail the IPPT and windows close* This one next week i ask.  *He also mention RT resume on april ? Anyone can confirm ?  Hope it helps you all. As from now, book at least 1 IPPT to avoid defaulter.  Good luck"
Thanks for the information. It is really getting messy. So in this case it is meaningless to go for IPT if unable to clear all 10 IPTs before windows close? So for those whose windows close on Feb/Mar it is advisable to book IPPT and fail instead of attending IPT sessions?
Book normal IPPT already still can book IPT meh?
You can use plenty of ippt and walk every time. Then next window clear RT. Or go ipt for some training and in the meantime clock sessions. Next window clear RT. Ipt ippt resume 17 or 18 or 19 jan. can’t remember which date but this is what the FT told us. So keep a lookout daily.
Wa.. hopefully they resume the IPT IPPT soon. Because totally cannot book any normal training as the system does not allow.
They really messed up my plan sial my 1st IPT session is on next Saturday and all way long I thought that it will be a IPT-IPPT session but now it seems like if we got attend IPT sessions but never took IPT-IPPT or IPPT and failed to clock 10 IPT sessions we will still be considered as defaulter. Now it seems like it is meaningless for me to attend the 3 IPTs that I have booked and I should book IPPT in this case. And the best part is we were never informed that IPT-IPPT have not resumed yet.
"jin messy leh, and my window close late March.  And what if they change of plans again and give a waiver to maybe NSmen window closing in the first half of this year? big IF.  I guess it will be good they make a proper concrete statement and address these concerns. Otherwise, no point we make our own speculation over here also."
Must apply for IPPT again.
They told u that?

For us whose windows closed on Feb/March we might ended up not being able to take IPT-IPPT."
"With that said, if next window is RT, then it makes no different since it’s 20 - IPT sessions attended - IPPT sessions attended = RT sessions"
I think it is the only way that I can do now as my main aim now is to avoid becoming a defaulter although I don't think that it is fair for us to attend RT next window when it is not our fault for not being able to fulfil our IPPT requirements in this window.
"I just called the hotline as well, the answer is about the same as Greent.  One additional note is that they tell you LLST just go RT next year, which is really unfair.  If can pass already pass, why we bother to book IPT IPPT?"
Greent had mentioned in his post that his OC will go to HQ tomorrow to find out the solution so we shall see how thing goes from there. Also I might contact my unit's S8 if necessary as well.
"Gg window closing end March, no ipt-ippt for me to book...I checked with their hotline and they only told me 50pax per session...so next window is confirm RT ZZZZZ"

"if u just want to avoid being a defaulter dont have to book IPT-IPPT. can just book normal IPPT and fail it.  if you want to avoid RT by taking IPT instead. actually it is the same. IPT is just you do 10 per year. but RT u do 20 per 2 years. still the same amount of sessions per 2 years, just you can't spread out the sessions as much for RT."
"I understand that for IPPT if never attempt or complete 2.4km run the attendance is not counted but if say I can't do push up, will the attendance still counted if I hold on to the push up position without dropping out in that 1 minute?"
 If can just do one and remove your tag. Same goes to sit up. You will be way more tired holding on to that position for a min.   I usually do 20 push up and remove tag. Then do 20 sit ups and remove tag.  Less than 3 mins done already. 
I will try my best and see if I can do 1 push ups at least. Previously I took IPT and their IPPT sessions are less stringent when it comes to clocking attendance but now now IPPT conducted during IPT so have to take non IPT IPPT instead but I am worried that my attendance will not counted if I fail to do even 1 push ups. For sit up there is no issues.

Normally I'll just do a few each. Then run one round then fall out lor. Attendance clocked

"u can fall out if is normal IPPT and still get attendance.  If RT-IPPT or IPT-IPPT (even if 1st time), cannot fall out, must complete the 6 rounds."
"Sorry to all bros here. I didn't log in for the past few days so i try to answered now.  ragegoh : Wait what? If we can’t book any ipt-ippt and window close we are defaulter?  Answer : U NEED to BOOK 1 IPPT session to avoid default.   Chao_Ah_Tiong : It is really getting messy. So in this case it is meaningless to go for IPT if unable to clear all 10 IPTs before windows close? So for those whose windows close on Feb/Mar it is advisable to book IPPT and fail instead of attending IPT sessions?  Answer : My understanding is you try to clear as much IPT if you can (to show you try liao when yr OC/S8 fight for your case) WHILE in the mean time, please contact your OC/S8 for this matter. It's important to let them know.  RocketBunny : Book normal IPPT already still can book IPT meh?  Answer : Can la. I already book 9 IPT sessions and 1 IPPT.  SKinny86 : Wa.. hopefully they resume the IPT IPPT soon. Because totally cannot book any normal training as the system does not allow.  Answer: I feedback to them last week/also my OC also that since 1st session must be IPT-IPPT slot but now change to normal IPT which mean many ppls stuck because system block you for booking the rest of the slot because first one is not fufilled and worst is only sat/sun"
"From now, book 1 IPPT and close case else book many IPT and offset for the next RT session (if appeal fail)."
If I not wrong Next week ipt ippt may resume. Keep a lookout daily starting Sunday.
Good to heard that but a bit too late for some ppls windows closing like feb or early march cause is way not possible to clear 10 session (or even have 5) esp those work 12hrs shift even worst (1 one of them).
"Thanks for your information. I think for our case, what we can do now is to book and attend an IPPT session and a few IPT sessions while at the same time seek help from our unit's OC/S8. I also agree that with a few IPPT/IPTs attended it would be much easier to negotiate."
"Hi all, got a question regarding IPT-IPPT on Kranji FCC.  I've managed to book a slot on April on Saturday 0930. It did not appear as 'NO-IPPT' when I was booking it.  However, the NS portal has yet to reflect my first IPT session as 'IPT-IPPT' (currently it is still 'IPT') and when I called them to clarify if got IPPT they say it is just IPT training.  Previously I only booked sessions at other FCCs hence this is my first time doing so at Kranji. Hence will like to check with everyone for those who had even to Kranji FCC, do they conduct IPT-IPPT on Saturday morning?  Thank you."

"Yeah bro. If you feel no point doing the IPT, then book 1 IPPT and close case while wait for RT.  If you want to offset (if appeal fail) then at least do less RT for next windows.  Anyway, my OC say just do your part while he try his best to ""fight"" for us. If end of the day tio RT, i also LLST.  Good luck man."
I need some advice on what I should do.  I went and took my IPPT today and failed. I was thinking of going for IPT but the earliest slot for IPT-IPPT is in April and my window closes in June.  So should I just wait and go for RT next window or book the IPT-IPPT slot in April? Am I able to clear IPT in 2 months if I can only do IPT sessions during weekends only.
"I maybe not give you the best advice but looking at yr buffer, i think you can book all 10 sessions on the spot since currently affected ppls are Jan/Feb/Mar ppls.  Maybe u chop 10 sessions first while you ask hotline since sat/sun no IPT-IPPT then do i need to book 1 actual IPPT to become 11 session (IPT / IPPT only) or 9 IPT + 1 IPPT.  So far the FI said 9 training and 1 IPPT = you clear this yr windows. (will check with them again this Sunday since my pattern is 9 + 1.)"
"I think what I’m facing is the same as many men here. My 2020 window closes on 29 June 2021. So far, i can’t book a single session of IPT-IPPT. All available dates are on Mon or Sun, which there is no IPPT conducted. It’s like this from Jan all the way till April.  I have an upcoming ICT next week. There will be IPPT conducted. I’ve also booked 1x IPPT in Feb. If i attend both IPPT, i would avoid becoming a defaulter right? Then next yr i will need to clear 20 RT if I’m unable to book any IPT-IPPT from now till June?  Did i get the situation right?"
"No IPT-IPPT sessions are conducted currently. Also, as long as IPPT is attended you will not become a defaulter and next year's RT will be 20 - Number of IPPT attended in current window - Number of IPTs attended in current window. You can also contact your unit's S8/OC for help at the mean time also. Afterall it is not our fault in this case."
"Just got off the line with the NS call center. They guy said as long as i attempt a IPPT session, I won't be charged as a defaulter. First 3 sessions of IPPT they will pay out ur rank pay. Subsequently they won't. He said the slots for IPT-IPPT are fully booked. He also said that if I attended 3 IPPT for this window, next window will be RT. They will minus the 3 IPPT days from the 20 days of RT. In that case, for guys that have no hope of passing / unable to book a single IPT-IPPT session, do ourselves a favour. Book 10x IPPT. Next yr just clear the 10x RT. This prevents us from becoming defaulter and reduces the number of RT in the next window."
why not book 20 IPPT instead then?
"I put that across to the CSO. He said its 20 sessions across 2 years. So even if I booked 20 IPPT now, next year I will still need to do 10 RT. So I will end up doing 30 sessions over 2 years.  Bear in mind that 1st 3 IPPT sessions are paid, sessions 4 - 10 are free."
"money is not the issue, is the time. IPPT can finish faster and can OTOT."
Yup must prepare for the worst by attending RT next window but not without seeking help from your unit's superior or S8.
"if u really can pass, just push for your 1st RT session to be IPPT, then pass it and fug off liao"
"I think the 1st, 15 and last session will be RT-IPPT. So yea, pass and fug off Lor.  I plan to take 1 IPPT per week for Feb. Clock 4 a month until i can book IPT-IPPT. If I’m able to clear 10 IPT from May - June, i will have done 8 IPPT + 10 IPT. I’ll just take it as a gift to Mindef."
How many ippt attempt can one made? I was just a point away from my pass  Posted from PCWX using waify Ganyu mobile
"You can attempt as many times as you want to pass and get your incentives. In terms of attendance, only the first 3 ippt sessions have pay."
"Hello, what happens if i clear the 10 sessions of IPT without passing PPT. Will the yearly ippt requirement be cleared?"
"Once you finish all 10 sessions of IPT, including at least 1 IPT-IPPT, you will have fulfilled the requirements for the window."
"Just went for first session IPT at bedok FCC this morning.  We were allowed to take IPT-IPPT. Most people were taking first session IPT-IPPT except for some who had already clocked some sessions before CB, who proceeded to do normal IPT. The PTIs were quite understanding that this is probably the first xiong workout in a while for many of us  We were told that more slots will probably be opening up in end-Jan given the heavy demand for IPT slots, so look out for those."
Then if we have booked a separate IPPT session can our 1st IPT session be one that do not conduct IPT-IPPT cos the IPT sessions that I booked are all on Mondays and I booked normal IPPT instead. By right my first IPT sessions is on today but due to work committments and I thought that there will be no IPT-IPPT session so I cancelled my booking and book a separate IPPT next week instead and my other 2 IPT slots are on Monday where there are no IPT-IPPT conducted so I don't know whether i still can proceed with the 2 IPT sessions instead as I would like to avoid being a deafulter and try to do less RT next window if appeal fail.
The system still allowed you to book your first IPT session on Monday?
Because during my time of my booking my first session was on today so the system can passed. And when I cancelled my session today the 2 Monday IPT sessions are still there. Anyway next week I will ask the Kranji FCC people as my IPPT session was before my 1st IPT session.
"Jin messy. My pattern is 9 IpT and 1 IPPT so consider fulfill windows ? Anyway, now on the way to BEdok FCC and ask the instructor If u got any questions, I try to help and ask after the session"
Just tried booking for IPT at Kranji. Now only have monday slots and no more Saturday slots??
"This morning i ask my enq to the admin so this is the latest news. I will do it like a Q and A so you guys can understand what gg on.  Q: I need to book 10 sessions (must have 1 session for IPT-IPPT) to clear my current windows, am i right ?  A : Yes. U need to finish all 10 sessions of IPT, including at least 1 IPT-IPPT, you will have fulfilled the requirements for the window. The system will help you adjust when is your IPT-IPPT and IPT only.  Q: If i cannot complete the WHOLE 10 session for IPT-IPPT program, what is the solution ?  A : You need to book at least a IPPT (NOT IPT-IPPT) to avoid defaulter.  Q: So you mean IPT-IPPT / IPPT is different system ?  A: Yes. IPT(IPT-IPPT) is diff from IPPT so cannot add together.  Q: My case now i managed to book 9 IPT (include today ipt-ippt) and 1 IPPT. That's mean i still need 1 MORE ipt to clear right ?  A: Yes. As above mention and please call unit to help you for this case.  Q: Will there BE MORE slot opening ?  A: Current plan by HQ is 24th or 26th of JAN 2021 (NOT CONFIRM YET so do check it out), we will open more slots for weekdays and will be 2 sessions (NOT CONFIRM YET) as we know this is an issue now.  Q: So IPT-IPPT still stick the same (SAT/SUN) only right  A: Yes. Still the same so please book your section correctly.  Hope my information is helpful and accurate as possible so please do a look out for more slot. As earlier most ppls here mention, at least do 1 IPPT before windows to void default .."
Thanks very much for your information. So in this case if one took IPT-IPPT but unable to clock 10 IPTs is still considered a defaulter? But anyway I have booked a separate IPPT. For me it is also too late that they opened up more slots for IPT & IPT-IPPT since my windows close on mid Feb. Anyway I have just feedback to my unit's DYS8 regarding this issue and she will get back to me.
"yeah. so long as you don't complete 10x IPT sessions (at least 1xIPT-IPPT), you are considered a defaulter. SO take a separate IPPT to avoid that. Later going for ICT.. Will ask them and update here if there's any new info."
"Thank man ! Hope all can clear as much as you can. Me need to book just 1 more IPT to close case. Anyway, how many IPT-IPPT inside this 10 session program ? My friend say 2 times (1st and 8th) session but my booking from 1st (ipt-ippt) till 9th session is IPT. Is there any changes as from now."
So we won’t know whether there is IPPT conducted on sat or sun unless we go there？  I can’t just waste time on weekend to go there only to be told there’s no ippt. I can go on weekdays no problem but weekend is really tough
can't check from the NS portal when u book?

"It's just like some of us last week, went for IPT on sat/sun become IPT-IPPT (stunt)."

Just booked a few months in advance for my first session IPT-IPPT (on a Saturday). It's also the only available IPT-IPPT slot :/  What's the IPPT status for you guys on IPT? End up just normal PT session or actually have IPPT?
"No changes. Spoken to my battalion CO about this.. He kinda said LL. Spoke to my OC about this at length. He said he understands the issue and will feedback upwards. We will see if anyone approaches me about this. As of now, think the best way is for us to either pass IPPT or take 1 session at the FCC to avoid default while trying to book IPT sessions. Seems like mindef is unwilling to acknowledge the scope of the problem."
All I can say now is to feedback directly to your unit's S8/DYS8.
I called ns.sg. IPT ippt has now resumed for all weekend IPT sessions.
Thank for the input bro. I'm also feel LLST lor but to either pass my IPPT before deadline OR do my 9 IPT (free) and offset the 20 RT - 9 = 11 session (earn the Make-up Pay but waste my time) unless i si be heng can get 1 slot within this 2 month ..lol
"If took normal IPPT (fail), continue to book IPT, my first iPT still need to be IPT-IPPT?"
i think need. The normal IPPT that you took will ensure you don't default. The IPT programme consists of 10 sessions. You need to complete all 10 with at least 1 IPT-IPPT.
"I think just do what you can. No point killing yourself just to pass the IPPT. Sometimes LLST, but when we have a chance to speak up, then we need to take it. I don't think I will go looking for my S8 or DYS8. No point. I already voiced out to CO and OC. If nothing happens, I already tried."
"anyone knows if more dates for kranji fcc will be released for pre-enlistee ippt as time goes?  currently the latest is on 3rd March, am looking for a slightly further date in March hopefully"
"Any time is also ipt-ippt? I booked a few session but now they don't indicate which day is.  I go few years IPT liao, only this year the system looks weird"
"Best to check with counter, but at least make sure when you book on the NS portal, the date does not indicate ""NO IPPT'"
"For maju camp lockers, need use coins or free usage? last went in 2014..."
"No need coin, all number lock"
Thank man. I'm also thinking just do the 7 section and give up the 2 section (bishan and punngol) cause a bit far from my home XD.  See how la. If i pass on feb 17th then i clear windows liao. After that july go back camp and clear 2021 one. Yawn ... 2 more times to de-kit. Ren ....
"Last year, you have ICT? I tot got covid?"
"fyi, they have opened up more slots on weekdays for IPT."
Isit a must to take 1st and 10th IPT-IPPT? Seen some say 9ipt+1ipt-ippt can le?
The system will detect if you never do ippt. The admin if they do their work will tell you to go IPPT if you never go once.
Thanks for the heads up. I’ll be skipping my ICT-IPPT. I’ve booked 10 sessions of IPT at Bedok FCC. Aim to clear 2 a week and complete my 10 sessions by March. This gives me buffer of a couple of months till June.
 Manage to book/amend some dates plus extra incase i cannot make it on time. Save my 2 AL instead of using 4 AL. *lol*  Need to clear my 2020 windows. No ICT for 2020 but did spot some NSmen went back for ICT while i on my way to do my HSP.
The way I see Monday got ipt ippt? The other weekdays got ippt? Can someone help me to ask fcc?
Monday and Sundays no IPPT.
Then now Monday 7pm session doesn’t indicate no ippt anymore.  
 Means change again.. Just follow what they say Lor..
"I booked last remaining IPT, the last session (1900 hrs) it still stated IPT leh. Will they auto switch to IPT-IPPT or not?"
"Hi, I've booked the remaining 9 IPT sessions (i have cleared the 1st IPT-IPPT session before CB), and for the last IPT session should i just book normal IPT or book a separate IPPT?  Because for IPT usually the first and last session is IPT-IPPT."
I have not taken IPPT.  If I have already taken IPTIPPT and 3 IPT. But unable complete.  Does it count as defaulter?
"Book IPT. just make sure that the slot you book does not say ""No IPPT"". then when you in pro just say you are here for last session. [Update 26/1]: Apparently the system has changed, and now the last session booked should be a normal IPPT and not IPT."
"Just came back for my 3rd IPT session and more story liao.  I'm ask the conducting what is the latest plan from HQ and he also very sian of how to explain cause HQ know the problem (many ppls rush in too clear) but HQ keep reshuffle ways to solve the problem (nv settle anyway, you can tell *lol*)  I told him today is my 3rd session (previous session is 1st IPT, 2nd IPT-IPPT) but system u need 2 (IPT-IPPT) 8 (IPT) to completed the whole program.  He suggest (mean he also not clear) that i go 6 IPT and 1 IPPT to play safe to complete the 10 program which lead me to confuse. Normal IPPT is not counted inside IPT program itself as last week admin mention ...  Anyway, i also feedback to him the slot open 20th (Thank to pstair for the headup) but last sunday u all say 26th leh. He also feel pai say say he will feeback and ask for more slots.   Just my 2 cents Do 1 IPPT and go for RT if you don't mind else if u can book 10 IPT then go ahead."
Yes. IPT-IPPT is seperate from IPPT. U need to go at least 1 time IPPT then they will off-set how many time u went for IPT to yr 20 RT session.
Ok thank you bro
Ns.sg told me clear 9 sessions ipt and 1 ipt ippt is enough to clear window.
"I also think this is the correct format to clear your current windows.  Anyway, the paper slip is important (also the Ns portal) to track yr attendance. Hope they don't change pattern again ..  Going this wed and see any update from them as they mention tue they will be getting updates from HQ."
"Called and got the same answer.. 1st to 9th session book normal ipt, last session must book normal ippt to clear.. He mentioned its a new directive.. Not sure if its true.  But the system doesn't show my 1st session as ipt-ippt anymore like last time."
"This is what I was told as well at FCC yesterday. Its changed from last time apparently. So the last session booked must be a normal IPPT and not an IPT session. I took IPT-IPPT for first session previously, apparently this will just be counted as a normal IPT training session, and it doesnt count as the IPPT session needed. For me, I am just gonna complete until the 9th session and then see how, cos the approach may have changed AGAIN by that point."

Version 1  9 IPT and 1 IPPT ( Normal IPPT) to clear windows  Version 2  9 IPT and 1 IPT-IPPT to clear windows  Version 3  Pass IPPT and Fart OFF   Those people 2nd session book IPT but kana the IPPT is IPT-IPPT or IPPT ? Apparently looking at my attendance is count inside my IPT program with the IPPT result.  Wednesday i ask the admin again.
Ehh wanna check if i book ipt-ippt for 1st session then 2nd to 8th do normal ipt red band training 10th session do ipt-ippt..... considered pass?
Yea cleared. That's what I always do previously
Speaking of the colour band. The auntie at Khatib fcc don’t want gimme brown band although it’s clear she still have a few. She gave it to those behind me.  In the end my colour band also merge with brown band
Last time pattern (base on system)  1st session (IPT-IPPT) 2nd session -> 9th (IPT) -> 10th session (IPT-IPPT).  Now come out this pattern (need to check again tomorrow)  1st session (IPT) -> 9 session (IPT) -> 10th session (book IPPT)  but the trick is system don't recognize ...lol.  Really prata into papaya.
"so many different version...  boils down to ""you think i thought who confirm"""
"They change the years-long system of:  IPT-IPPT (1st) --> 2-9th (IPT; any training of your choice) --> IPT-IPPT (10th; last)  ???  They did not even post any changes to the system, as far as I know."
"Really u say, i say who confirm."
Tomorrow evening i ask to confirm. Need to clear this part as v confuse to everyone.
I'm at maju camp now. FI say this  1st to 9th IPT lesson is training. 10th lesson is normal IPPT.  That's the info they have now.
Thank for the information. It's mean we only take 1 IPPT and that it. Tomorrow i need to ask my doubt cause some of us 1st or 2nd session thought is IPT but become IPPT so that one consider we took the test already ? System got record my IPPT result
Let us know tmr!
Yes pls. Update on this. I dont want attempt IPT - IPPT but still end up as a defaulter leh
 I have feedback to my unit's S8 and the outcome is positive. But then it is on case by case basis...
"Sure man. I'm will ask them during the briefing.  Anyway, the booking open earlier than 26th of jan."
That is what i was told at bedok yesterday as well
Do they mean like normal normal ippt or ipt ippt?
"Same, I’m in the same situation as u and I asked the FCC just now. He understands that I’ve took IPT IPPT in the first session but he wants me to cancel the 10th session and book as normal IPPT to play safe. Still confused because the system will say I did not complete the IPT."
"Now that MINDEF has spoken, there's two versions:  (1) 9 normal IPT, last (10th) session is IPT-IPPT (2) 9 normal IPT, 1 normal IPPT  Now the clown guessing game continues..."

"Back from bedok FCC and today the FC head explain to us how the MINDF system works RIGHT now.  1) NO MORE 1st/10th for IPT-IPPT pattern under IPT program. The new system is 1st session to 9th session book IPT. YOURS 10th session go and book IPPT to clear the whole IPT program.  SYSTEM will not TELL you anymore what IPT-IPPT liao, you need to calculate yourself and book correctly else u GG.  2) Those EARLIER do IPT before CB , or start off BEFORE 26th of JAN, you need to follow the new pattern (base on his explain)  Example my case 1st session : IPT , 2nd session IPPT (Under IPT program) and cont till 9th session as IPT then 10th i must book IPPT. *mean i do 2 times IPPT*  Those kick off from 26/1 will be follwing the new patten 1st session till 9th session all book IPT and 10th you book IPPT.  Hope its help you all those need to clear by feb."
I also heard this also. U can req before you take your color band  I think only FRIDAY no IPPT. Correct me if i wrong.
Can request does not mean always have. Must check the timing and date for IPPT.
"Is the IPPT icon missing at your booking page ? My page can only see IPT/E1PEP-IPPT  Or it mean when i in-pro during my IPT, i can req for IPPT ?"
Is it at previous page. (Main page) beside ‘access eservice’ under ‘Manage IPPT/IPT/RT’ I see that on mine
Thought those need clear by Feb is exempted?
MINDEF asked us to contact our unit's S8 and they will access on a case by case basis on whether our IPPT window can be waived.
"Nope. My main page only shown Access eservice and IPT. Even i click the Access eservice also no IPPT but IPT icon and E1PEP IPPT unless i need to cancel the current IPPT booking but again, last time can book more than 1 times :/"
" Only up to 7/Feb. Those > this date must clear IPPT.  Singapore Armed Forces NSmen whose IPPT window closes on or before Feb 7, 2021 will be granted a one-time waiver.  https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ill-get-tested"
Thanks Bro Greent! Sent from . using GAGT
Same for me. IPPT icon only shows up if I don't have any IPPT bookings currently. So only can have 1 IPPT booking. Ya I also last time can book multiple IPPT at the same time. If you cancel your current IPPT booking then the IPPT icon should show up again (but I think it's best if you don't geikiang and try now lol)

Anyone here lost a reservist ict cycle due to the pandemic? Wondering if mindef will count the lost year as one year orns cycle cleared
Why would they count if you didn’t clock?
"Wait long long  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
Nope. They won't count ... too bad ...
"This image has been resized.Click to view original image   Bros I replaced my last IPT session with a normal IPPT liao...was one of those that did ""IPT-IPPT"" on the 2nd session but apparently it just counts as a normal session now so anyway my concern is like will the system update the count as 10/10 once I clear the normal IPPT after my 9th session? Because based on this image it will become like 9/10 instead. If system don't recognise then I kana charge..."
Yup. My 2nd session IPT-IPPT become normal IPT (base on system) so i also same like yours  5/10 and standby with 5 IPT (in case is 10 IPT and 1 IPPT = 11 session together). but we should be on right track.  Tomorrow i will verify with the trainer again and will shown him this print out to double confirm we are on the right track.  As far as the head Bedok FCC mention to us last week The new patch ppls is 9 training and 1 IPPT or 1 IPPT 8 training 1 IPPT.
"With ""IPPT"", it's normal IPPT or IPT-IPPT? How come now so chiu cheng? One single programme end up branching out into another."
"Normal IPPT.  Inside system, they already removed this ""IPT-IPPT"" so when u click IPPT icon you are on the right track."
"Hi, last year most people's IPPT requirements were waived off right. I defaulted on RT the previous year before, got charged and paid the fine.  But now I see online, I seem to be able to book IPPT and not RT.  Is it last year waived cos of covid then considered last year cleared so can book IPPT again?"
den just book IPPT and pass it. no need to care about RT
RT have not been resumed yet. Only IPT have resumed.
"Yeah, can go 1 time instead of 20 times  Chao_Ah_Tiong wrote: RT have not been resumed yet. Only IPT have resumed. Because previously, if default RT, next year cannot book IPPT, still must complete RT. I dunno is system cock up or is it because of last year waiver, somehow became cleared can do IPPT again or what"
Yup. RT still haven't resume yet and latest rumours is in april  If now system only IPPT then just clear it ba
Back from Bedok FCC.  The pattern still the same. 9 IPT and 1 IPPT or those before 26th of Jan 1 IPPT 8 Training 1 IPPT.  System will auto add 1 to get your 10 IPT in the windows.  There will be changes AGAIN in APRIL after MINDEF finanical year
"I have friend who wants to do IPT like me, but his window closes some day in May. We're starting in March. So is it advisable for him to do IPPT first, then the remaining 9 IPT sessions? That way, at least have IPPT to cover and prevent default."
"*Update 11.50am* *5/2/2020*  Just now i received a call from MINDEF about my email send on 28/1/2021 regret to unable to book IPPT as icon don't appeared. Anyway, i already resolved the issue  She told me base on my record, i no need to go anymore IPPT because i already done my IPT-IPPT on 17/jan (those 2nd session IPT become IPPT) so just need to fufilled the reminding IPT and close case.  I'm ask her bedok FCC instruction is those done theirs IPT-IPPT program before 26th of jan need to do 1 more time leh (which is the 1+8+1) and her answer is those ppls book under IPPT not IPT program so my 17th of Jan session already fufilled the 1 IPPT under the IPT program.  Anyway, i strongly suggest you guys call in and ask them to CHECK your record IF you already done your IPPT (under IPT) or need to go 1 more IPPT to wrap up + ppls already 9 session of IPT and 1 more to go so will that IPPT add into it as 10th ?"
Yes. He will be void as default BUT he might need to do IPPT again cause he havent' kick off his IPT session yet as instruction come down is 1st to 9th must be IPT and 10th is IPPT.

I got a letter from NSAD that due to Covid19 there is no HSP so I am exempted for IPPT for my window.  However when I see my NS portal it states I still required to take IPPT.  So listen to whose instruction?

"Hi, if my unit waive my IPPT requirement (My window closes after 7 Feb but unit waived on case-by-case basis, I was informed of the waiver from my DYS8 through Whatsapp) will they sent a official letter informing me that my IPPT requirement is waived or just the whatsapp conversation between me and the unit DYS8 is enough for black and white? Thank you."
It should be enough. Most important is to keep the whatsapp message for proof purposes. If really kenna SAF264 then contact your unit's S8/DYS8 again.

No.. 1st session is no longer a IPT-IPPT. 1st to 9th is just IPT. 10th then u book a IPPT. At lease that’s what NS contact centre clarified thru email.

Not open.  Sent from . using GAGT
"Hey bros,  Saturday i went for my IPT and manage to get the 4th update from the OC.  For those who want to clear their IPT program, the requirement is to have 9 IPT and 1 non-ICT IPPT. Now the IPPT can be ANY session in-between 1th to 10th session so you no need to wait until 10th session then book IPPT.  Example  1/2/3/4/5th session IPT 6th session IPPT 7/8/9/10th IPT = Clear your IPT  Do remember to check your account to check your record/attendance purposes  As for RT, i heard is after financial year which is end of march. If any difficulty to clear/book, please call unit or SAF hotline"
"thanks for the update!  my window closing end March, i highly doubt can clear my IPT in this short period of time."
"Can IPPT be taken as first IPT session? I have friend whose cycle closes in May, and we're starting IPT on first week of March. He might not be able to finish 10 sessions, so I told him to book IPPT first to cover his butt. If 1st IPT can take IPPT, means he don't have to take IPPT twice. (Once for IPPT, the other as part of completing IPT)"
Can but seriously ask him take his ippt first to avoid summary trial. Ippt slots makaned damn fast.
Thanks for the update regarding RT. Hope they open more slots. IPT no slots liao.
thank you for update
"Yes bros.  In your record, you must have taken at least 1 time IPPT can liao.  To play super safe, please don't book your IPPT as your 10th session in case FCC cancel on that day or shut down for the next few days/weeks etc ... nobody know ... so play safe"

U welcome ! Hope my information can helps whoever facing the issue now.  I not sure will there be anymore changes AFTER this MINDEF MARCH financial year as i heard some rumors before CNY during my IPT session but from now .. clear asap first.
Currently have to book as a dedicated IPPT session right? Not sure if they will apply upon request on a booked IPT slot.
"U mean you initially book IPT but on that day u want to change to IPPT right ? If so, i think you can ask them and give reasons like tell them ""no more slot or windows deadline soon etc""."
"Went for my first IPT session at Bedok Camp yesterday. Its super chill now. Compared to previous years, this is damn relax. Basically you just go there to clock your attendance. I think you ownself go gym, also more xiong.  Do declaration, choose your band colour, go in-pro. Then chill until 1900 when training starts. I chose weight loss (green), so we did a light warm up and then went to the gym liao. Finished at around 1950 and then out-pro. Its rather slack now, so please please try to complete ur IPT to avoid default.  As mentioned previously, those whose windows are closing, please go book 1X IPPT. Clock the attendance then write in to your unit or call NS hotline to appeal. Once you avoid IPPT default, everything is easier to discuss.  To note: bring your own water bottle to camp. If you need, they do provide plastic cups, but you need to dispose of them after training. You won't be able to drink from the water fountain. They sort of 'taped' it off."
"Can. You can only book 1 IPPT session at a time. So you slowly book lor. Note that 1st 3 sessions are paid, thereafter its not."
"Now since 1st IPT session doesn't need to be an IPPT session, does the 1st IPT session needs to be done at FCC, or it can be done at IPT in the park."

Apparently green tag got BMI requirement. I tried to join in a previous session but was not allowed to as my BMI only 27. Haha
Received sms from mindef. They waived off my RT for this window.
did u email or contact them about this?
"No, never leh"
green tag must be buibui de
My BMI 21.7. But if I don’t go green tag. I might become default green tag.
"The other groups more xiong, you confirm won't enter Green if you go for others.  I went for Yellow and Blue before because my friends were there, I was close to getting out of camp by ambulance... I am that unfit, that's why I stuck with green. (Yes, I'm obese)"
I also received sms from MINDEF today that my RT is waived for this window also.  I did feedback to my unit's DYS8 before my window closed and got a waiver.
Last month my first session I went blue. I almost blackout. Eyes seeing stars like in club like that. The surrounding sound like echo. So I pace myself slower abit and tahan till outpro. Don’t know is it become we do burpees then mountain climber then push up or not. All blood rush to head
"Anyone recently go Maju for IPPT? Do they still have the extra push up machines + screen at the side for you to practice/check your form before you do the actual test? Last week I did ippt during ICT, the machine keep no counting me, I sibei pek cek. I'm asking in case they closed the practice eliss machines due to covid"
"I went for 3 sessions over 3 consecutive weekends. Years-long inactive me did not see much progress other than walking out completely zombified and drained. (And racing heart + headache for the next 5 hours) Green is just the right pace for me, enough to make me sweat and pant (and see stars if I push myself harder during the gym period). I'd only go Blue if I'm a lot fitter."

"Not really need to go FCC. Just that FCC got more slots and can clear faster. The last I checked, IPT in the park got no slots. Its all the way till May liao. If your window closes within these few months, best to go to FCC to clear the sessions."
"Yeah. Seems like it. Obvious bui bui or got injuries before. That time got 1 skinny dude join, then the trainer did a double take. Finally the dude said he had a previous injury. So join green tag."
I think it's time for them to put back Jurong Central Park and Pasir Ris Park for IPT in the park.

my friend told me push up machine fked up. he do 55 but machine count him 35 only. but he go over ask the cisco pti to review the video can finally count his push up to 45.  wa didnt know can review video.
Does anyone know how service pay is being calculated? Is it tag to salary? (Attend IPT counted 0.5 days)

"Shortly after guardhouse, turn right. Got an open air carpark beside the running track."
Can ask the guard where to park. Actually can park almost anywhere.
"My friend got say, those who wear black colour or dark colour shirt all kenna, the push up machine/camera cannot detect, something like that. You wear dark colour ah? Did they allow you to try the push up machine first? Long time ago at Maju, they open 2 extra push up eliss machines at the side with camera and screen monitor, not for IPPT scoring, but for you to ownself try. You can see and check your form and do a few to know if the machine will no-count or not. The trainer also told me what I'm doing wrong. But that was before covid, I long time never go liao, dunno if still have or not"
"I each year (never got called back at all) the pay slowly creep up, also CPL now reach $19, previous years was like 14...16...17..."
Surprised that the ippt monetary reward is now almost instantly credited via paynow once you scan out.
"Window closing in June, how high chances of waiver? Haha"
"Unless FCCs were to close during Mar-Apr, practically no chance   My friend's window close in May also not exempt, still have to rush to book and attend."
"Just book 1 ippt and attend first. Next time take 19 rt.  If you rush 10 sessions this window, next windows also must do 10 sessions so it's the same."
Very hard as by right from january to June there should have enough time to clear 10 IPTs.  If your windows closing on mid/end Feb and Mar then chances are higher when you seek help from your unit. And I believe if your previous record is good i.e clear IPPT requirements every year then it is even better to seek for waiver.
I'm heng to clear my window before 27/2 (my deadline) and thank to 1 of the bro at this group mention they open more slot and is like midnight 12am++  Now my new IPT windows is on April for 2011 windows .... cab relax a bit now ...
"I email ns.sg, and this is the reply I got. Apparently, it's different from what the OC have said. Quote: Please be informed that IPT sessions slots are open from 26 Jan 2021 onwards and NSmen can start booking the sessions from 21 Jan 2021. NSmen can now start an IPT programme without an IPPT session (i.e. NSman can book any IPT session as the first IPT attempt). Please note that the 10th IPT session (last) will remain as an IPPT attempt. Do book a non-ICT IPPT session (not IPT) for this last session. In order to complete the IPT programme, the non-ICT IPPT must be attempted on the 10th IPT session."
"Maybe u want to call the hotline, apparently the MINDEF hotline lady and the OC mention the same things which is any slot can be your IPPT."
"I emailed Ns.sg. The ippt can be any session between 1st to 10th session. Don’t have to be the last.  As long as you attend 9 ipt sessions and 1 ippt regardless of order, you clear window."
"Greent wrote: Maybe u want to call the hotline, apparently the MINDEF hotline lady and the OC mention the same things which is any slot can be your IPPT. Wa lao, means their customer service give me wrong advice? How come they so inconsistence one?"
Usual saf cockup lah and this is a new arrangement confirm the information not disseminated properly.
I verified with fcc oc already. He say actually any session in between can already.
"is it a must to pass the IPT-IPPT (10th session of IPT)? If fail to clear the IPT-IPPT, does that mean the next window need to do RT?"
As long as you have attended 9 IPTs and 1 IPPT (By 'default' it should be 10 IPTs including 2 IPT-IPPT on the 1st and 10th sessions) you are considered fulfilled your IPPT requirement regardless of whether you pass or fail the IPPT and the next window will still be IPPT/IPT.
"Hi can I check if i failed my ippt in the last window, now I have to book RT for this coming window. But I know that I will be called back to camp for reservist this year, which there is a confirmed ippt session. Can I just pass the ippt session during reservist to clear my window for this year?"

next windows is RT 20-n (number of IPT-IPPT attended)  so if you completed 10 ipt-ippt = next year is 10 RT  RT and IPT are belongs same training session liao
I did my ippt a few days before my window close (first week of March) and failed. Today I check the portal to book RT. But it states my 2021 window is open again for IPPT. No RT. Anyone faced the same issue? Weird.
Probably waived like mine. RT waived. Have u received the sms from mindef?
Ohh maybe. Not yet. My new window just opened 2 days ago. Probably have to wait?
Wait for around 5 days after your birthday to receive your waiver sms.
I'm completed the whole IPT 4 days before deadline and 1/3/2021 i received this waiver sms -_-;  Now ask me to clear 2021 windows by next year.
"On the bright side, you do get paid half-day for each session. And you also brought us valuable first-hand info and experience."

This one even ask me to book an IPT-IPPT, not non-ICT-IPPT"
"Very confusing. I think the most consistent advise so far has been to book a normal IPPT session to fulfill the requirements. Then book and clear as much IPT as you can before the window closes. If you fall short, then have to go to ur unit to appeal."
"can, done it before (around 2 years back)"
I think it is better if you contact your unit's S8/DYS8 directly for this matter.
Just went to ns.sg to ssrr and they haven't resume 6pm sessions on Tues to Thurs and Monday got 5pm sessions.  Hope they can resume the 6pm session soon so I can go straight after work and finish the IPT earlier.
is maju camp fcc closed? i'm trying to book an ippt slot but doesn't show any bookable slot available in mar. (booking module seems to be working as kranji fcc is bookable)

Yeah nowadays the slots lesser nevermind the number of ppl needing to take stays the same really haiz
"Hi I am new to this forum.  I had completed only 9/10 ipt as shown in my ns portal but the status is shown as below:  ""You have Completed your IPT for your current window. You may continue to book sessions if you wish to improve your results.  Your next IPPT window will open on 1 Jul 2021.""  I did attempt a non-ict ippt (in the same window) before starting the ipt program, in this case, do i still have to attempt a non-ict ippt to clear my ippt for my current window?  I am scared cos they said ""Completed your IPT for your current window"" and not completed IPPT for current window, when the instructions says that ""The 10th IPT session (last) will remain as an IPPT attempt. Do book an IPPT session (not IPT) for this last session.""  Right now I am still thinking if i should attempt the non-ict ippt session that i booked for tomorrow night.  It's my first ippt window, so I am new to this and unsure if the message: ""You have Completed your IPT for your current window."" means that I am done for ippt requirement for current window.  I had already seek help from NS portal live chat service, but their operator replied that they will escalate to my unit and advise further, get back in 3-5 working days.  Any helpful replies will be good, thanks in advance."
"Sounds like system cock-up? My understanding for IPPT obligations is you have to clock 1 IPPT attempt. If you can pass, can just aim to pass in ICT. However, its actually better to pass IPPT outside of ICT, as taking IPPT during ICT usually means having to say the night before (7hrs sleep), unless you stay very near the army camp and can cham shiong with your unit. You aim to pass IPPT in ICT if you are the borderline can maybe pass IPPT type. You clock the non-ICT IPPT liao. So now you have to complete all the necessary extra sessions, be it RT or IPT. You only clock 9 IPT sessions, so you have to go one more. Unless the system has changed liao since my time (I MR liao). You kena taiji back to your unit. Scali your unit taiji back to NS portal. And you still owe the last session, so no idea why still need to clarify with unit. If you can still book via the system, I think just book the last session can liao, then you no need to worry anymore. If you have problem booking the system somehow, I suggest calling the hotline, confirm that you still owe 1 last IPT session, and then let them know your booking issue with the system."
"Got Bros here say that the IPPT attempt can be taken at any point in time during your window, don't have to be the last session. As long as system say completed, take a photo of the page and you should be safe. From my POV, you have completed the cycle. Sent from . using GAGT"
"Hi guys, 1st session of IPT is no longer ippt now? Have they changed without informing ? I can't clear my ippt and am prepared to take RT next window though."

"Completed IPT also means you fulfill your IPPT requirement until your next window liao, which begins on the day after your birthday, 1 July as you have stated above. MINDEF will also send you an SMS within the next few days saying that you have cleared your IPPT and tell you to stay fit. If you receive that SMS means done liao, don't need to worry."
"To fulfilled your IPT requirement  You need to have 9 X IPT session + 1 X IPPT (Non-ICT). The IPPT (Non-ICT) can be taken any session in between your 10 IPT session.  Example :  1-4 session : i take IPT 5 session : i take IPPT but fail (If pass IPPT, you can FISH off liao) 6-10 session : i take IPT and i clear my IPPT windows for that year.   Please CHECK your NSportal after each session (the next working day) to check your record is been updated and keep your ATTENANCE PAPER (FI pass you that paper after each session) as evidence incase cock up etc ...."
Appears that there is no RT if u managed to clock at least 1 ippt attempt in your current window I'm supposed to have 19 RT sessions but on NS portal I can only book IPT and IPPT. Don't quote me on this but I think the RT system is set for a major change.
The OC told us on Tues that RT is no more. Must wait for minister to announce new programme.
Hope they just open more slots whatever programme they introducing the current state of affairs really cmi
"wa, nice. finally  RT is just punishment only...should make it pass get $ but fail no punishment"
"If RT is scrapped, that'd be a good direction. For most, even going through the entire RT programme, end up still cannot pass IPPT. So I don't really see the point in having so many sessions in the first place. Not to mention the amount of precious time taken and potential opportunity cost to go through the programme.  As a punishment for defaulting IPPT, it also doesn't seem to be a good deterrent, compared to heavy fines. Turning up for RT also nets the offender half-day NS pay for each session anyway. Most likely to no detriment to their income too, as the sessions are attended at their chosen time."
WoW ...  Let's wait for the financial year to end in march then will know the new program by april.
Sian I failed my IPPT. Anyone knows if go RT can choose to use the Gym in the FCC?  I see above said no more RT le?  If true yay
Hopefully to see some changes to IPT as well. Like reducing from 10 to 8 sessions for example?

"King.Koopa  Since you fail your IPPT, is your windows close already or receive any wavier from MINDEF ?"
"SINGAPORE - Instead of attending remedial or voluntary preparatory training for failing their individual physical proficiency test (IPPT), operationally ready national servicemen (NSmen) will from April 1, 2021, need to complete a new 10-session NS Fitness Improvement Training (FIT) programme.  The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) announced this on Monday (Mar 15) as it unveiled plans for NS FIT to be available at 45 locations islandwide. There are currently 13 sites where NSmen can undergo training.  Under the new programme, NSmen will be able to choose from at least six different NS FIT training activities to fulfil the required 10 sessions.  They can register for sessions through the ns.sg portal from March 25.  Currently, those unable to pass IPPT can opt for 10 voluntary IPPT preparatory training (IPT) sessions, or participate in up to 20 remedial training (RT) sessions.  Brigadier-General Kenneth Liow, director of National Service Affairs, said NS FIT would streamline this ""complicated"" system of annual fitness requirements into one common programme  Each NS FIT session, lasting approximately 60 to 75 minutes, can be easily fit into NSmen's busy schedules, he added.  ""The vast majority of our NSmen meet their fitness requirements,"" said BG Liow. ""NS FIT is aimed at trying to promote a more healthy and active lifestyle.""  The programme is one of the NS review committee's initiatives and also a collaboration between the SAF, Health Promotion Board (HPB) and Sport Singapore (SportSG).  The three organisations had in 2017 signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote fitness and health among NSmen.  On top of existing training locations at parks, Safra gyms and Fitness Conditioning Centres (FCCs) within army camps, NSmen can choose to undergo NS FIT at an additional three upcoming gym sites under ActiveSG - the national movement for sport - and 29 locations under HPB's Quick HIIT (high intensity interval training) banner.  The Quick HIIT programme, started in 2018 as a first initiative under the MOU, is conducted seven days a week at malls, community spaces and SportSG facilities.  It is open to the general public and features short bursts of high-intensity exercises that build strength, endurance and aerobic fitness over time.  This is similar to metabolic circuit sessions conducted at FCCs, which also offer activities focused on aerobic threshold, weight loss, sports and IPPT-specific exercises.  Sessions at the Safra gyms are customised based on individual needs, and should an NSman decide to attend NS FIT at one, he will have to compete all 10 sessions at either of the six dedicated FIT @ Safra gyms.  The programme at the upcoming ActiveSG gym sites - in Bedok, Jurong East and Tampines - will be confirmed later.  The 10 sessions include one IPPT attempt, to be taken at the NSman's choosing. If he passes the test before the 10 sessions, he will not need to fulfil the remainder.  NS FIT was trialled from 2018 to 2019 with about 250 NSmen, including a brigade commanded by Colonel (NS) Michael Hua, 49.  He said: ""The feedback we got from the guys from the ground was (that) it gives them flexibility, and offers convenience. More importantly, it allows them to integrate fitness into their lifestyles.""  NSmen's friends and family can also join them in their Quick HIIT sessions by booking a slot using HPB's Healthy 365 mobile app.  Home Team's NSmen will also adopt NS FIT from June onwards. They will be able to undergo FIT sessions at Home Team premises, HomeTeamNS Clubhouses and ActiveSG gyms.  https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-fit-programme"

Interesting. I have a IPT session later. I'll go ask them how about those currently doing one.
So is this in lieu of RT or rebranding of IPT? So should we take FIT in next window after we fail ippt in this window? Confused
Same. I also a bit confuse by the long statement ...  Shall wait for the bros here to update us ....
Surprised it took then this long to change the word IPT which confuses everyone with the IPPT programme.  Dunno who is the goondu who come out with the word 'IPT'.
"so if fail current IPPT window, next window take 10 sessions of NS FIT? rinse and repeat?  No more 20 sessions of RT?"
"RT no more but not sure how does it work exactly for this new system. Like this FIT, is it take after failure from current windows or take as if it is IPT. What is the penalty for not completing 10 sessions etc. all unknown. FYI, i also went to peek at this HPB FIIT. apparently, it is super popular since this is also for normal folks and it fully booked for the next few weeks. No wonder, every time i walk passed, it is always crowded So not sure how does it work when can't even book this HIIT...."
"From what i can see on their website now  This image has been resized.Click to view original image   It seems to be similar to IPT. just more options of locations  This image has been resized.Click to view original image   If never finish FIT or pass IPT will get charge, but then next window still need to do FIT  This image has been resized.Click to view original image   Good thing is more locations..no need travel to safra or FCC...which is plus point. My location 5mins walk got one FIIT..but hard to book."
Swee lah opposite my house only
You got the link to the article? Can't seems to find it.
https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...ics/ippt-nsfit  Nsportal. Click infographic
So can i put at this way (correct me if i wrong)  Windows Open  Do this FIT X10 (include 1 IPPT) = Clear window  Windows Close  Never complete FIT/Fail IPPT and didn't attend FIT = Tio charge + need to attend FIT on the next window  Correct ?
"SAF rolling out the new scheme Apr 2021.  Since MHA uniformed services ie SPF/SCDF NSman will only have the new stuff roll-out from Jun 2021, in the interim, follow old scheme?"
"https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...ics/ippt-nsfit  Website up now. Quite clear.  The FIIT is interesting, at least it is like few mins walk from where i am staying. Much better than the FCC one.  Problem i would see is the FIIT is actually popular with the public so it might be problematic in booking..."
"Yup for me I don't need to travel all the way to Kranji and Maju FCCs (Except for IPPT) from Jurong where I lives and works at. And yup I think they should add in more slots or impose some quota specifically for us. Just have a check on those nearer to my home one (Jurong Lake Gardens, Jurong West SIP etc) and it seems like they only conducted once or twice per week and all sessions are full. Anyway it's not a bad thing as instead of doing IPT/RT with all guys now maybe there are some chio bu doing exercise with you."
"seems like - 1 window (take 1 ippt but fail) , 2nd window (do 10 mandatory NS FIT), 3rd window (take 1 ippt if fail), 4th window (do 10 mandatory NS FIT), rinse & repeat."
Actually this whole system is just open to abuse confirm will have problems down the line. Old system was 20 sessions in 2 windows now it's 11 sessions in 2 windows
"RT regulars will love it  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"Yeah makes u wonder for those that confirm fail who will even finish the 10 sessions in their window. Just fail and go 10 ""mandatory"" sessions in window 2"
Ofc lah bro I'm loving it
not yet. I just booked another session this week last try le. Was planning to chiong. But after hearing about no more RT change to simi FIT programme effort drop by 20% liao . 20 sessions really cannot but if 10 sessions I dont mind
"I don't think the ""disciplinary action"" applies to those who fail IPPT la. That's kinda absurd. It's for those who default or never complete the window.  But yes, now that no more RT, it's a gaping loophole for ppl to attend (and fail) IPPT on one year, and go mandatory FIT for the next, and repeat. Or it's supposed to be this way?  Anyone went for the QuickHIIT or the activities in the Parks (current ones, not under NS FIT), can share if it is as xiong as the Blue and Red bands at FCC? (Metabolic, aerobic etc) My fitness is not even there to go through these kind of intensity, end up resort to going for Green (weight loss). Dunno if there's any activity at Parks that is somewhat equivalent to the Weight Loss programme."
"Not sure if its loophole since they would have knew of this when they start new system Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"This image has been resized.Click to view original image   This image has been resized.Click to view original image   Because if you don't pass IPPT or complete your FIT, not only need the mandatory sessions but also subject to disciplinary actions (Meaning charge)"
"That doesn't make any sense. I'm sure it only applies for defaulters. If not, how many ppl they need to charge for failing?"
Shag lo means nothing changed just ipt with more locations oh well
"Must pass. If fail, must complete 10 fit program.  If never go at all, charge and kena fines."
"Yeah that is it. Just like the old RT but cut down in half. Just thought it to be misleading that simply failing IPPT will result in charge, as anyhowsay said."
"Means if fail , you have to complete 10 fit in the same window? Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
The program already 1 ippt built in so 9 fit sessions plus 1 ippt
It seems is must do the FIT within the same windows.
"If like this once your window open must quickly go take ippt. If fail at least you have more time for FIT. If you wait until your window ending then take ippt and fail, not enough time to complete FIT means die?    Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"Means 1 window you either 1. take ippt and pass 2. you go for FIT 9+1 to clear window  Take note if you want to take ippt must be early so that if you fail at least still got time for FIT before your window close. Dont last minute  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing 🙏🏻"
Yeah good summary
Just a change of name from ipt to fit.  Finally all become fit zai. Thread can close already!
"My window opened 10 January  I just logged in to Ns portal . Only IPPT or IPT option. If i want to go for the FIT, must wait for 1st April? Slots open for booking already?  If lets say my ICT in Aug and taking the FIT route, i complete my window before ICT, means ICT IPPT i can dont attempt or fail? Wont affect right?

"My windows closes on 30 March. Just realised islandwide, IPPT slots are all fully booked. How ah? LOL Usually only book 1 or 2 weeks before window closes...  Also has IPPT@SAFRA resumed?"
"New system will only start in April. Since your window close on 30 March, you have to take ippt. But if fail maybe will waive since they only start April and no time for FIT. Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
Ya my window closed ytd I only attempted 1 ippt and failed. This window no RT just do ipt/fit. But my friend that didn't attempt a single ippt u know I know lah
"From NS.sg Not in the same window In your IPPT window, you can attempt as many times as you like  Actually the way they word 'IPPT Window' is also kinda misleading, as they're talking about the cycles, regardless you take IPPT or FIT of your choice. Mandatory FIT is replacement for RT."

Just called the NS Call centre. Told me it would be waived. Just need to either take the NS Fit or IPPT for next window. Phew...

Just finish the 9+1 in ur current window u will be fine.

Can't relate eastsider here confirm damn packed for tampines.
"West sider here. Your window open alrdy?  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
Ya but I booked IPT sessions for now. A lot of slots opened up cos of this new FIT thing can try ur luck
"I dont want ipt. I always pass 3 station ippt. Last year mine was waived. This year not confident can pass alrdy maybe have to try fit.   Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"The HIIT event i think quite hard to book, i used the Healthy 365 app to check, almost all events full till 11apr sunday, and events after 11apr haven't release.  I think the new system is more like every month go once or twice if choose to join those public events, relax de. If want last minute clear the 10 sessions need go back fcc."
"Will only know how the bookings are on 25th march when slots are open Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"ggwp, and my window closes in APR."
"So is it (a) just take ippt, if fail, nxt window take 10 mandatory fit over 12 month or (b) take 10 fit within window to meet ippt requirement?  If go for (a) it's like 11 session over 2 yr and (b) 10 session every year?"
In your option A u will get charged first. If you know that you gonna get charged u should just not attempt ippt in ur first window unless u can pass lah obviously
I am quite confused... Think they need to make clear whether we will be charged if we fail our IPPT. Don't think MINDEF/SAF is that stupid to make us abuse the system anyway.
If u fail ippt but u finish another 9 FIT sessions considered window cleared. If u fail ippt but never finish FIT or pass IPPT in another attempt u get charged lo simple.
In order to clear your window: Pass your ippt or (ATTEMPT 1 ippt and finish 9 FIT sessions). If you do not clear your window you will get charged.  There is no more RT which means the days of leaving sessions to the second window is over.
"Ya from the infographic it seems like if you got attempt IPPT and fail, but never finish 9 FIT sessions after that within the same window, you will be charged. So have to really plan your time and sessions carefully le. If you not confident that you can pass, then just take FIT.  Last time attempt and fail still nvm, won't be charged as long as you do 20 RT next window. Now attempt also can kena charge..."
Ya correct and last time RT sessions is 20- D. D is the number of ipt and ippt u went for in the previous window. Now it's all or nothing liao.
"Think should be the same. If you chao keng, it will be 10+10"
"No. I think if you default in ur previous window. You get charged + 10 ""mandatory"" FIT sessions only. Not sure about the 10+10 will wait for info from the other bros.  Edit:called NS hotline it's correct there is no 10+10 it's immediate charge then next window u do 10"
Ya la.  But think the charge is fine + 10 more.
"This HIIT is pretty much the same thing as IPT... Simple as that.  Only difference is that instead of two IPPT sessions, this new system is just one IPPT session.  So it's 1 IPPT + 9 HIIT to clear your window..."
"Hiit is the name of the programme conducted by external agency. They do mostly static exercises such as pilates, dancing and boxing or even burpees. Quite easy when they are a lot of people.  But if only 3 person in 1 session, then very siong cos instructor look at you so many times and instructor also ps so keep telling you to exercise here and there. Good if you like intensive training."
"Who will choose hiit if got gym? Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
Today newspaper mention that you need to clear your FIT at the same venue. I'm not sure how this FIT actually works but guess i stick back to FCC ...  2 more year to ROD liao. ren a bit XD
"Not confident just straight go for FIT. Dont wait until when ur window closing then you take ippt. Run 2.4km very stress 1. If fail , must be sure still got time to book FIT. Dont forget FIT got ippt also. So you take 2 times in a window Might as well just go for FIT straight. Then last session ippt 2.4km you run shag liao and walk also nobody care. Because no pressure to pass liao mah Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
I think ippt attempt anytime is ok. No need ippt twice
"As in dont wait until last min to take ippt. If you cannot pass you have to squeeze 9+1 before your window close. Thats taking 2 ippt alrdy to clear for the year .  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
As in the +1 u can take anytime so u need to squeeze the 9 FIT sessions but yeah don't procrastinate
"I just return SG upon completion of my studies overseas, tried to log on to ns.sg and to my awe, I couldn't book any IPPT slots. How ah?  First timer here, please go easy on me"
"Wait for 25th march , fastest finger first. Once you see slots open, quickly book those sessions nearest to home. Book as much as possible. Book first then say .  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"Pending any last min urgent work, I will be able to clear my 9x IPT + 1x IPPT by the 31 March. This would satisfy the IPT requirements for my current window. I've already gone for 5x IPT at Bedok FCC. For next yr's window, I think I will still go back to the FCC to do the FIT training. Just book 3 sessions a week clear within 1 mth."
"You mean all FIT have to be same venue? Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"Sessions at the Safra gyms are customised based on individual needs, and should an NSman decide to attend NS FIT at one gym, he will have to complete all 10 sessions at the same gym.  Took from straits crimes. But it appears to only affect those that choose to take FIT in SAFRA"
"Confirm all will go to the gym nearest their house liao. Who want to go HIIT or FCC for more exercises? Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
This will cause problems down the road bah bro. You see ah people already have trouble clearing all 10 in different locations. Now u need to clear all 10 in the same safra u play the odds lo.
BTW for SAFRA gym you have to pay $214 (members) or $267.50 (non members) https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...bhiit-safragym
"Why clear 10 in different locations?  The normal person will just clock 9 sessions in safra gym nearest their house.  Then ippt just go through the motion . No pressure to pass   Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"Can try FIT@Park. If not then go FCC. Mixture  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing 🙏🏻"
"Safra is similar to E1 Pep. Need pay $$ I done it few times in the past, by right got customization. But then is basically OTOT, do your own stuff can do threadmill and weights etc. then 1 hour late check out. If don’t want do just don’t do at least safra. Or watch tv also can"
"I'm still waiting for confirmation from NS Contact regarding the charge for failling IPPT and have to attend 10 Mandatory FIT sessions within SAME window. Anyone got official confirmation that is the policy now? Until now, only see what's stated on the somewhat vaguely worded infographic, but nothing from official sources making it clear.  Only SAFRA gym cannot change location, because of the ""customization"" per individual. Pretty sure the rest is as per usual."
anyone waiting for FIT straight? i have a IPT-IPPT upcoming sunday so i think i gonna go there once and then take the remaining 9 sessions during the FIT
"Is ippt on 10th session , not 1st session  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"Doesn't matter one. 1st, 4th, last all no problem. So long as u clock 1x IPPT session. Then go clear the other 9 FIT sessions."
"I would say there will most probably be limit to the no. of pax for FIIT@Parks due to space constraint. And it be seen in the video that its a smaller group. The majority still have to go to FCC one.  Just go FCC bah. 2 sessions a month for 9 sessions then book ippt to attempt it. No pressure to pass. I also come from IPT anyway before the 3 station ippt. Have passed everytime for the 3 station ippt until this year where i feel not confident liao.  Left 2 more cycles (this year 9th ict). Just finish it loh...  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"Doesn't seem like it's a must to do FIT until following window if you choose not to after failing IPPT in current window. Also, since IPPT is attempted, definitely never default on IPPT.  And another one on what defines as defaulting on FIT: 14. I am unable to complete 10 NS FIT sessions within my IPPT window, will I be considered an IPPT defaulter? If you are unable to complete all 10 NS FIT sessions within your IPPT window, you will not be considered a defaulter. However, you will be required to complete a mandatory NS FIT programme for your next mandatory NS FIT window. The following point states if Mandatory FIT for following cycle is not completed, will then be considered as defaulting.  It doesn't state anything on FIT being compulsory if one fails IPPT, and can get charged for not completing it within the same window. It is a personal choice, but Mandatory FIT comes in the following window, which must be completed."
"There is no clarification if fail ippt , FIT must do in same window Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"It only states that you can opt to do FIT. It doesn't say clearly what if you don't. If they allow choice in the first place, then logically, nothing will happen other than having to attend Mandatory FIT next window. Completing FIT within same window just means you can choose what you want to do on your next window, instead of having Mandatory FIT. Will wait for their official confirmation and share here."
"I would say in the same window , you either pass ippt or take the FIIT  Because this scenario is HIGHLY unlikely  2021: fail ippt 2022: FIIT 2023: fail ippt 2024: FIIT 2025: fail ippt 2026: FIIT  But rather 2021: pass ippt 2022: pass ippt 2023: pass ippt  OR  2021: FIIT 2022: FIIT 2023: FIIT  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"On the other hand, there could be someone who may want to repeat many attempts at IPPT, and IPPT only, until they pass or get incentives, and not want to do any FIT activities. I don't think it's logical to punish them for not passing IPPT and having to go FIT within same window. Especially if it is officially stated as a choice. I'm just talking in logical terms. Whether that is the case or not, still waiting for them to confirm. So far, all the speculation on how it's to be interpreted is very confusing."
"What do you mean by repeat many IPPT? Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"Someone just wants to attempt only IPPT, perhaps until can get incentive, and not go for any of the FIT activities. Think of it this way, under current system, if you can choose between taking as many IPPT attempts as you wish until you reach your personal goal (i.e. incentive money), or you can choose to complete IPT and complete the cycle and then leave yourself free to choose for next cycle. This is up to personal choice. If still fail, next cycle do RT."
"You mean keep going for ippt in the window?  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
Yes. I updated the quoted post with an alternative perspective if I didn't get across to you earlier
"I will just choose ipt and next year free to choose. I see no point keep taking ippt  Last time before the 3 station ippt , i also belong to ipt group. Every month i just pick like 2-3 Saturdays to go maju fcc . Ippt really no pressure to pass when you see those 2.4km really run until mad.  Its just that for FIT you only need ippt at last session. Iirc last time ipt is take ippt 1st and last session...  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing 🙏🏻"
"Same here la. But if there's a choice, it: 1. is a ""loophole"" that they are aware of, and is intended 2. makes no sense to force someone into FIT within the same window of a failed IPPT attempt or face charges, since the following one would be mandatory already (like RT, but cut half) If choose to take FIT but never finish within window, next window then would be mandatory, must finish or face charge. In the end, still cannot escape from defaulting in any case. So purpose is still served."
"Yes. There's a space constrain. Meaning it affects how many servicemen can book for a FIT session at a particular location. OC FCC mentioned that after 1 April, they will increase the number of bookings for the men. Weekday IPPT sessions at the FCC will be at 1700 & 1800. FIT at 1900. The usual remains like no IPPT on Mon and Fri. Weekends I'm not so sure cos I didn't pay attention."
"If fail ippt, fit need to be in same window?  Such a critical question and yet they dont even address it.  So frustrating  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"

Ask stupid question get stupid answer.
Your rank paid. i LCP and get 22.05 cents per session.  Hopefully this july ICT i can pass my IPPT then relax for a while ..
Seems like there is an increase on the allowance. I did not take IPT last window due to waiver and the previously I usually get less than $20 per session and my rank is 3SG.
Actually last time also got IPT @ SAFRA gym and it was within walking distance from my home but I rather go FCC or IPT in the park (back then when Jurong Central Park still got conduct) as it is not worth to pay and clear your IPPT requirements.

Yes. last time they have this E1-PEP which is IPT in safra gym. Need to pay that amount as well.  Which is why i super seldom see people participate in that
"Basically if you dont do the 10 session FIT, they will force you to do it the next window. If can pass, best la. If not, just do the FIT loh."
https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...faulting-nsfit
"This will be more relevant actually Means this scenario applies 2021: fail ippt 2022: mandatory fit 2023: fail ippt 2024: mandatory fit Rinse and repeat This is good for those who know they cannot pass ippt but dont want to straight go for FIT as they only have to take FIT in the NEXT ippt window!!!!!! https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/h...ndatory-ns-fit This image has been resized.Click to view original image Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing 🙏🏻"
"To summarise, when they say you nv complete the FIT, it means you can choose to take or dont take in same window. There is no difference.  Eg.  Fail ippt and only complete 5 FIT sessions Next window mandatory fit  Fail ippt and nv go for FIT Next window mandatory fit  So of course choose 2nd option lah  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"if my england neh fail, seems that u can even skip IPPT on first year"
"Yes you are right but next window you have to go for FIT  Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
"If that is true really good news But then question on this is That mandatory FIT does it fulfill the current windows or just the previous one? Simply is Mandatory FIT is it the same thing as FIT? FIT can fulfill current windows but mandatory FIT seems to be to fulfill not doing FIT or passing IPPT Meaning in your model, if 2022 fail IPPT after completing mandatory FIT, meaning 2023 need do mandatory FIT for failing IPPT for 2022 windows?"
"I guess they're assuming I'm referring to IPPT taken together with FIT. But explicit enough to say if never complete first time round (e.g. only do IPPT, never do 9x FIT), next cycle is Mandatory."

"Yup. I just want to see their confirmation. At least now sense is made, and black and white is there. Aiya this window just go take ippt . If fail next window go take full FIT 9+1 sessions to clear window After that can be ippt again or FIT again is 2 years later problem liao Most likely will join my friends do all 10 sessions every cycle.

"Is it possible to sign on as PES C9. Hello! A little bit of context here. I’m currently at the start of my National Service, enlisted on 2 April to BMTC School V but was sent home due to circuit breaker. Because of this, I’m having difficulty gathering the necessary information I need for a potential army career.

I spoke to my section commander over videocall a few days back about the possibility of signing on, and from what I gather from him, the only possible route I can take will be the Military Expert scheme because I am not combat fit and therefore wouldn’t qualify for officer scheme, and because I will be starting a degree in 2022, WO Spec will not be suitable as well. Just to do a fact check, can I really sign on as an ME as a C9?

A little bit more background; I was downgraded by the MO back when I did my checkup as I have mild eczema and childhood bronchitis. Nothing more than that. When I had my one to one interview with my PC, he was equally taken aback because the downgrade might’ve been a little too drastic. Hence, if there were to be a need that I’ll have to up PES in order to sign on, I guess my chances are there as well?

Would appreciate any information/feedback regarding the above issue :) I’ll be booking in on the 8 of May, and my Section Commander has stated that if I do have intentions of upping my PES status, he will send me to the MO straight on 8 May."

I feel like my anxiety's getting the better of me.  It's been progressively getting worse, and I don't know what to do now.

I can't help but think that my sergeants are coming after me.  I believe that they want to harm me, therefore I must go out of my way to harm them first, be it physically or mentally.  I can't help but think of the amount of joy and satisfaction I'll get from watching blood spill from their carotids or the amount of sorrow and / or annoyance they'll feel when they realize that someone's been cyberstalking them and misusing their contact information for all the wrong reasons.  It makes me feel safe thinking of all these things.

"Hey man I understand where you're coming from but it is not worth it to keng and down PES. I was from the obese batch BMT ( 5 months ) and now PES B1 but I was posted to driver. Its good and bad to be in PTP batch (which is what you are in) as you have lots of time to really get to know your friends inside, which will make time fly by quickly ( but 4 months++ is still something lol.) It is just 2 years, take it as a break from the real world. You do not need to try your best, just live day by day and spend your bookout with your loved ones, it will be over fast.
All the best for your NS journey!"
What about people who pretend to require a down PES? like I've heard of ppl pretending to be depressed and stuff
"Eh, but that's already an unlikely scenario in the first place.  Not that I have any official statistics or anything, but I doubt that there's a shortage of PES C and E servicemen, which means that OP could very well end up being sent to a combat vocation."
"sure, there are cases like that. my brothers bmt batch had a guy who pretended to have low iq and straight pes f. do you really want to pretend having something that you dont tho? it feels disrespectful to the people actually suffering from it,  train yourself up so that ptp wont be as tough and you can handle it better than your peers, you will meet all kinds of people in ns and just learn to keep a healthy distance from the troublemakers. i cant speak for saf, since im in a different service but from what ive heard from my friends who enlisted earlier and those in bmt now, pes b1 doesnt mean you will get chiong sua unit, sure you have a higher chance but anything can happen, dont be an ass to others, try to learn quickly ( unlike me) and understand that your sgts and sirs dont really hate you, in the end most of them are NSFs and are waiting for the much awaited ORD. i would advice not to downpes by doing something to yourself as it could affect your life forever, ns is 2 years. why do something when no one gives a fuck where you were from in work, you can be ocs/ndu/commando/guards/scdf/inspector/infantry/storeman/driver asa end of day you just want to pop, ord and complete your cycles.

make good friends and treasure your remaining few months and time you have with your loved ones, dont keep counting down to it you will feel worse. i wish you all the best and good luck in ur ns journey"
"I’m just curious why you don’t trust your brother who has went through NS of 2 years and instead come here to ask.

Yes there’s only confinement in PTP"
"Confinement is only during PTP, however, there's multiple reasons for booking out on Saturday.
There's stuff like field camp that might eat into the weekends, there's also weekend guard duty, and some coys just do Saturday bookout etc."

"All said, dont be surprised if you ever book out on a Saturday morning/aft instead of a Friday night. It happened to me quite a bit when I was in BMT."

"Quite unlikely to bookout on the Saturday tbh, since ptp batch have a lot of time, activities no need to be rushed. Furthermore, there are not many other companies to fight against for a good bookout time"
"I assume you're talking about the BMT phase after PTP. Jokes on you, since you're from the PTP batch, they'll try to clear your high keys earlier compared to the Enhanced (Non-PTP) batch. This means doing things such as your grenade throw etc earlier compared to your batch mates. 

Normal bookouts should have you out by Saturday morning, but if your Saturday is taken for training (yes, it happens, especially for high key events where special venues are required), you may end up booking out Saturday evening."
"Profile says ""fuck life don't pussy out"" look and here he is. X to doubt"
Go to ur OC or encik tell it straight to them most probably a emergency send out will be done.
"Lmao typical chao keng loser. Before you fuckers downvote me, his profile says otherwise. Have fun being a bottom bitch in this here mean green war machine."
But by all means do ask for help
"Please stop using ""Forgot to apply"". It's almost impossible to forget to apply when all your batch mates are applying.

1) As a NSF, you have 2 or 3 times to apply for Uni since uni starts in August. 

2) Let your PC know in advance when your test date if it's on the weekdays. Usually Uni will cater interview on Saturday for NSF."
"usually if you have a test or interview for uni stuff just let your commanders know in advance and they'll try to release you for it.

&#x200B;

whether or not you have time to study really depends la. i'm from a welfare coy so we get more admin time, meaning more study time. other coys who are more xiong might give you less (or negative) admin time so you can only study at night (past lights out, don't get caught) or during bookouts.  either way, if you intend to study during BMT, only advice is to work fast so you dont waste precious admin time on your phone or slacking when you could be studying."
"You can apply for university every year until your year of matriculation. Local universities will reserve your spot till you complete NS while foreign universities depend on their policies - generally a year but do enquire with their admissions office.

University admissions usually has an interview and/or test. They can be conducted for any days but do inform your PC about it and they can allow you off to go for these admission tests. Else, the most they can do is for you to take an annual leave for it.

Generally, the tests are not very technical in nature and do not require extensive study UNLESS you are going for advanced placement modules(generally for polytechnic students)."
Do some people apply to university after NS?
"I almost nearly ""forgot"" to apply as a poly student. The application closed while I was still in school and I didn't even know the application was open. Luckily one of my friends asked me if I had submitted my application and I did it on the spot. It was the 2nd last day of the applications."
"Ah to be fair, the forgot to apply is cos I haven't enter BMT yet.  
Thanks and ah didn't realize the interview was on Saturday."
I think have but why waste time. Since you might get rejected then need wait a bit longer
"Very unlikely, if not impossible"
Nope.
"In jc year 2 now? If yes, then impossible alr."
Later you kena Guards. Lol
When would I know if I kena Guards? I never indicate interest for that.
"Where does the anxiety stem from? Might have to explain that to MO.

Though, can see them excusing you from smart 4 and make you wear long 4 instead."
Yes
"If that is the case, I'll be going to IMH a&e tmr~~~~"
"Specialist > mo. If psycologist says excuse uniform, mo will excuse you. Whether IMH psychologist gives you what you want is a different question"
Google it :D
"Call up your new unit and ask.

This one, I'm not sure. My time was just wear No.3 book in with the sling bag, note pad, and water bottle."
"I dont think you HAVE to do the pre enlistee ippt, but im priddy sure you can. Passing your ippt wont make your pes go up as your pes is dependant on whether you have any medical conditions, not on how physically fit you are."
"Passing won't up pes, you just skip 8 weeks ptp if you pass"
"Pes b2 doesn't have to take pre enlistee ippt, it doesn't matter if you pass or fail everyone in b2 goes through 9 weeks bmt / 2 years service.

No of course passing won't get you to pes a/b1, thats your medical status not a measure of your fitness. Need to see MO if you want to up/down pes."
"Is this fear due to pre-existing conditions or what? If you OOC due to injury and your injury is deemed too serious, you won’t be able to recourse and you’ll just end up in a slack vocation after a possible downpes. In which case no SCGP for you since you won’t attain a 3SG rank."
Ooc then no more 3sg unless you recourse with the next batch. But that's unlikely
"With Ur medical condition you'll end up in a  slack CSS vocation (storeman, driver, asa). If you ooc pro term they will try to push you to become to sgt anyway like admin spec. Most pro term ooc ppl becomes specs and majority of them get hq stayout vocations"
tbh theres no diff being a REC and a PTE. Only the hair
"afaik there is no significant difference btw a rec n pte tho. same pay, essentially the same rank (who tf wears a pte badge?) and same hierarchy. the one reason for this might be that you dont have a posting yet so they cant promote u? just don waste the 2 years and enjoy the measly pay."
You said one month bmt? Are you PES E? PES E are locked at REC for 6 months after bmt
"Bruh. The promotion will happen in due time, who cares if you’re a recruit or a private between now and then. You seem very fixated on the black and white of ‘only privates are eligible for promotion’."


It takes time. The system quite slow. Not very quick.
"I was an ASA for my NS, had to do some paperwork for my own promotion too. 

The rationale behind the delayed promotion is so that the 'real soldiers' don't get angry that the 'chao keng' gang get a fast tracked promotion/more money."
"My advice would be to approach your PS/PC for help with your addiction rather than attempting ""any creative ways to make more money as an NSF"" because that's the definition of moonlighting; making more money outside of what they give you.

&#x200B;

\-Approach your PS/PC for help, there are protocols to assist servicemen with financial problems.  
\-This does not affect you negatively in any manner, at the least much less than if you attempted moonlighting.

&#x200B;

Also, I have no idea what FL services are but if you know you're addicted stay away from those kind of things."
"You need to seek help for your addiction, and not finding for more ways to earn money to feed it. Spending all of your money is a deleterious habit, especially if you’re blowing all of that on chicken and not saving the cash instead.

Look, at the end of the day I know it’s your cash, your life, your rules. But now you’re admitting that you have an addiction. Something in your life is out of balance.

Talk to someone."
Have you considered opening an investment account with the help of your parents?
"Giving tuition on weekends is an easy way to get money, it doesn't take up much time too if you can convince the students to go to your house.

Can't remember the market rates... I think for secondary school, it is about $30-40 per hour?

Back then, I just wake up around 10am, brush up, prep the area and chill until 11am. 

Student come in, teach until 12+, goes for lunch and rest of the day is mine. 

&#x200B;

If you do it on sat and sun, that's an easy $60-80 per week, which adds up to at least $360-$480 per month. And what did it cost? Your morning? :D"
"Whatever job you take on the weekends/free time, take your pay in cash. Don't take pictures, don't be seen. Best if you do warehouse packing."
Whats FL services?

"Brother, it is not that I don't want to give tuition but my grades are UUAS/ABU. Like that how to give?"
boy is getting ripped off then
":0

I guess I too good boy liao. This one never hear before."
"you talking about jc grade or sec sch grades?

my jc grades were CDEC lol. it’s pretty fked up.

did decently well in sec sch tho, so i teach at that level lah"
Local FL average is around 500 leh at Singapore bike forums
FR 500/1/1?Never heard of such price in sg.i really want to know.can u pm me?
Yes if you have a transport hr account. Your unit S1 can activate it for you.
I’m enlisting on the same day and time so see you there I guess!

"Not really, but just wanted to see if anyone here knows"

Thank you for telling me!

Thanks! Confinement just got over :)
"Pes BP is fuckin fun bro. Because its 19 weeks all your activities are spread thin which basically means you get a ton of admin time everyday. The first 8 weeks, expect 2-3 pt sessions a day, but its still manageable because of the emphasis on progressive training. Relax bro dont take it too hard."
"Am PES BP recruit done with PTP phase.

Typical day would look like this during your first 10 weeks...

|Time|Activity|
:-:|:-:|
|0530|Reveille|
|0545|Breakfast|
|0700|First Parade in PT kit|
|0730|PT|
|0930|Admin/Lecture/Other Activity|
|1130|Lunch|
|1430|Admin/Lecture/Other Activity|
|1630|PT|
|1800|Dinner|
|1900|Last Parade|
|2230|Lights Out|

Quite slack but PT is going to be tough because they will make you run, push up and crunches a plenty. 

You'll also be doing 3 klick route marches during PTP phase and one or two actual BMT stuff."
Run a total of 5km for Morning and Afternoon and swimming daily for first few weeks I think
Ah I see thanks bro!
Idts leh... i was from last year pes BP
call SAF hotline :(
bruh like dat also want to complain abt being unfair? how about complain before ns compulsory guys don't have to serve....
I’m guessing you just POPd....
yes but i still report back to camp bruv
just find this to be very dumb complain
Not u shinryu I was talking abt OP
He just salty at our batch
So he want us to suffer
Idiot
Higher pay like what... that’s not going to happen
ya this thread is dumb lmao
I understand why he’s upset but like just let him vent I guess it won’t change either way
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
bruh ur basically complaining about doing what you USUALLY would be doing for NS. suck it up stop acting like a quniang and get over it
Go complain to your superior and see what he says or if you really unhappy go to news
"So you think you should be paid more because ur risking ur life, but how does extending our ord benefit you? You just want us to suffer because you have to go into camp"
Our batch having one month added to our ORD won’t affect wether you get the virus or not... ur just salty
"I understand your frustration but not your suggestion that the April enlistees should have their ORD extended by at least a month. Feels like ""I am suffering now, so they must suffer too"".

Sorry bro, NS is like that, the older batches will always say the newer batches have it easy (""back in my day...""). And we're all in the same boat of having to serve the nation, so let's not sow discord among ourselves."
"this is some fucking boomer mentality jesus, just bc you “suffered” means other people should “suffer” as well? get over yourself"
agree with the increasing pay part but i feel like the ord date for new recruits should not be extended because it is just their good luck and we should feel happy for them lol
"I definitely feel you tho, as someone who's considered essential service and serving a month long confinement, it definitely sucks to see other NSFs working from home for the same duration. What's worse is when all dies down our compensations is probably a whatsapp text saying ""Thank you for all your sacrifice and service in the past few weeks, we are so proud of you."" The end. It would definitely be great if there were some form of welfare given back to us that we actually would appreciate and personally for me that would be off days instead of cheap fleeting words of thanks and recognition.

Back to the point of the recruits, wishing for their ORD date to be pushed back will only make you feel your life is better - by comparison and accept your situation more but objectively it doesn't really make your life better. Rather when wishing others had it worse so our situation looks better, I just hope we get better taken care of."
understand where you coming from however does it do any good if extend their ORD? let's due to this crisis ask you extend your ORD to help out with ops leh? you sure rage what. I only can say they are lucky ar. if you have any concern just speak to your commander about it.
everyday alot of negative news liao. so just focus on the positive one all of us owe 2 years and need to pay 2 years. when I suffering and see people relax I also cannot say extend their ORD.

bruh i POPed the same time as you and i’m going back to camp too lmao
"If your S1 wants to keep you, then youll stay an ASA. If they rather you hold rifle go pew pew, then youll rebmt, assuming theres enough time - BMT 2 months, voc training 2 months. If you can serve \~1 year after you revocationalise, then most likely they will revocationalise you."
Ok thanks for your help. Rifle pew pew once enough alrdy tbh
"Really depends on how u look at things ar. 

Commander comes with great responsibility as they need to take care of your man. 

2 years is a long time. Maybe u can start to look at how u can improve yourself as person. Is okay if your goal is abit diff from others :) after all it is your milestone :)"
"Hey, despite what everyone says, it comes down to whether or not you personally prefer that sort of life. If you think that you are unable to handle too much pressure or dont think that you want to do it at all, then being a man is perfectly fine. Remember, serving 2 years as a man can still be meaningful. It is just what you make of it. Meaningfulness is what you make of it, so don't be pressured to go to cmd sch just to get sth out of NS. I suggest you ask around for others' experiences in OCS/SCS before you make a decision. The more info you have the better a decision you can make for yourself. Also, asking whether command sch is worth it is a very personal opinion so I suggest you ask more probing questions about life there suited to your concerns so you can decide for yourself whether it is worth it."
"Personally, yes. Being a commander gives you more freedoms and allowances to do your things, but do note it does come with additional responsibilities. If you haven't yet, I suggest keeping and open mind and going through field camp first before coming to your definitive decision.

I should add that on my end, I wanted to go command school to help myself grow and put myself out of my comfort zone. Basically, I went in of my own accord, and to prove myself, not other people. I can say it definitely helped me grow as an individual faster than I would have outside and even where I fucked up there were lessons I learnt from it all.

It's a great time also to practice your leadership skills, and at the very least, that's something you can carry over to the working world (yes, army leadership isn't exactly the same as civilian leadership, but there are some things you can carry over). If you're unsure tbh then your BMT is a great time to try out leadership and to see how interested you are in it - ask for a platoon IC role for instance if you wish and see how comfortable you are with it. And know it's okay if you don't feel like command school material or are just disinterested. It's a personal choice and one shouldn't be forced to go command school - I never forced my own recruits to go there, for instance, and I respected their decision no matter what, whether they wanted to be a man or commander.

End of the day, I feel this is a decision you should make - We can only advise and show you the way, you take the step :)"
"I guess it’s quite easy to be swayed and follow the general crowd of wanting to go to command school but it really isn’t the thing that defines a meaningful experience. If you didn’t really have much of a leadership experience prior to NS, it could be good to take this plunge of becoming a commander, a decent opportunity to learn new stuff. But at the end of the day, if wanting to be a leader in this organization is not your thing, it’s fine to not go command school.

Being a man has its perks too and moreover it’s only two years of your life. There’s much more things to pursue during NS and it’s easier to do so when you are just a man. It’s perfectly fine to not follow the hype if you don’t want to."
"When you're in bmt, everyone dreams to have command. But when you're a commander, you would wish to just be normal men. With higher ranks means higher responsibility."

2. IRAC ( kinda small intake also)
3. ASA aka Clerks ( Bulk of pes e9 NSFs)
4. TO ( few , mostly pes c9 and above)
5. Supply assistant aka storeman ( Bulk of pes e9 NSFs too)

P.s source pes e9 nsf from april bmt batch"
"Yes it’s possible. 

But during the switch you will still undergo ndu training."
"Just apply for the scholarship now. You will probably start undergoing NDU training first but will intermittently be pulled out for ME and scholarship interviews. Once you are confirmed for the ME scheme they will post you out of NDU completely and you will be at some air base, waiting for your OCS (ME) course to start."
The switch happens after bmt ?
"Alright, thanks"
"I think if your reason for signing on is to ""travel around the world on navy ships"", it is very superficial, and you have no idea what naval divers go through."
bro I think we really cannot ans this. I think alot of naval diver info is confidential as per my understanding
Call navy recruitment Center bro
"its not really the reason, just a question. if i wanted to ""travel around the world on navy ships"" id just partake in a midmanship. I just want to know if ill be leaving my family for long periods of time before i decided to sign on"
i understand. I can call the navy directly i guess. Thanks
haha didnt think about that. Thank you.
"For NSmen, no. If something happens, the backlash would be incredible. PAP doesn't have the political capital for that.        

For people who signed on, they do get sent on UN peacekeeping missions. Actual warzones, in flash-points all around the world. To my knowledge, SG peacekeepers are always stationed far from all the action, so there has been no casualties thus far. I'm not sure if they even had a chance to fire a shot."
no
Army no unless you regular. NSF closest to combat is navy.
No.
So regular got go war?
"Yeah adf or SF, people were deployed to Afghanistan I think, about a decade ago."
Oh i see. Not anymore? Also SF you special forces?
Don't know any current deployments. Yes SF is special forces.
most likely manpower shortage..
Bro I dk how to answer leh. We wun know why
"Best guess, manpower shortage"
Manpower shortage? Superiors didn’t like you? Myriad of possible answers that you can’t get from the internet.
You are weird as fuck
There’s no such thing. Are you that horny?
"I was in raven company for the intake in March. Raven company has a platoon full of girls, it was cool :D"
"When you are inside, no wearing of civilian clothes. How many sets they give you, I'm not sure but also no choice but to rotate used clothes or wash your clothes. Some of my friends don't wash them cause lazy or little admin time. So I guess when you have admin time, use it to wash your clothes instead of using your phone so you have fresh clothes to change into."

"3 sets admin 2 sets PT, don't bother bringing another set of civilian clothes"
"And also try not to over-pack coz they’ll be giving u a massive field pack and duffel bag which u have to carry along with your civilian bag to and fro from locations to your bunk. Basically, it’s gonna be tiring af."
Hey man what time are you enlisting on the 28th of September?
Mono 1sir?
"I would recommend bringing in 1-2 pairs of comfortable home clothes to wear at night. Helped me as I could use my admin and pt pairs for more days than my peers.

For PT ( or any friekin activity), you have to wear your admin/pt/no 4 uniform with shoes ( sports/ combat boots)."
will they provide us a pail to wash our stuff?
"wtf 16, means 19 days inside camp?? gggg"
"then if not enough to wear throughout the day, how sia?"
wait whats inside the massive field pack and duffel bah sia? oh shit man
8.45am sia :(
dun know whats that
Yes

"I had 18 day confinement too, it’ll feel horrible the first few days but it gets better. Just push on :-)"
"29 sept, 18 days here. Feelz."
"Haha bro just wear 1 set admin and pt throughout the day, the next day change the the second set and at night go wash. Third day can dry and wash the first 2. Pt kit can reuse once or twice with febreeze"
"Boots, shoes, utility pouches and belt, helmet etc. Everything u need is in there"
my batch (mono 1sir) pop this friday boys!
oh ya is Febreze impt to bring in?
HAHA SHIT LA FML
wah bro i 1 more day than you :)))))
Feels bad for us man....
"Yup, snake brand powder too"
They do to a certain extend. But there are still numerous people from ITE that enter
"There’s an IQ and personality test during the Vocation Assessment, they mainly chose from there instead of education. (As seen from the A level batch enlisting before receiving their results)"
Source?
"This is true I am, currently still serving in helldon camp :), poly batch will have a few from ite. I think jc batch maybe 1-3?"
? From the people who have seen ite commandos or have commando friends
Both
Both
But if u don’t get into commando u can still choose to sign on commandos during BMT.
Its not a qn haha i meant to say that is the source. ??? is for his comment
Ah i see thanks man!!!!!!!! 👍
I thought commandos is only mono?
Yes but still can sign on (apply) during your BMT if you are not in mono commando BMT . Whether they accept you is another thing.
o interesting
"You’ll have to go through a few courses (one of them being Rangers and I believe you know what the other is.) in order to be considered a regular Commando. Requirements for regulars and nsfs are different.

Ps, did not expect to stumble upon your reddit account here :p"
"Just prepare yr items and maybe a spare set of uniform in camp so u can go camp n change and report in almost anyth
There shld be some form of communication abt the mob manning tho so just look out i guess"
"Before ORD also have mob manning. In my active days, I had 2. But luckily both never kena activate."
"Mob manning unfortunately applies to everyone, even NSFs once in unit,  until you ROD 🤧 ( however, if you’re lucky, you won’t get activated :D )"
How do you not have a superior?
"My direct superior is technically my CO, but I don't see him every week, and I don't want to call him just for this.

But I'm just wondering how I have mob manning because I didn't think it would happen until after ORD"
"7 hours yes, toilet is one of the best in saf. BMT is holiday compared to ocs ah but it rly depends which wing u go"
"Training in OCS is a different league than in Tekong. You have tons of outfields to go, almost like every week go once that kind of thing. Physically and mentally demanding. I know a few that wants to OOC, not because they cannot handle the physicality but because it’s too mentally demanding. You will start to compare yourself in OCS, and others living as a man in other vocation and wonder if everything you’re doing is worth it. Honestly, if you don’t plan to sign on as a regular, going through OCS with the mindset of wanting to become upz is not worth it. You need to have the passion and desire to lead people then I’d say go for it. 

You no longer have to queue to shower or shit anymore, there are a lot of cubicles. Oh and you will love the bunks here"
"Didn't go through OCS but I heard from PC in BMT that yes the 7 hours is a thing but they allowed cadets to self study past the lights out time so I guess the 7 hours isn't enforced as much. And as he said before, you probably would need to stay up and study or plan the missions etc"
Tbh just be prepared to chiong sua the next 2 years
"Officer Cadet School is shiong, no doubt but batches and batches of cadets commission from it, so it is not impossible. Physical intensity wise, it is far tougher than BMT, much much tougher, but training is still progressive, they won't make you do insane stuff right off the bat.

7 hours of uninterrupted rest is only enforced at times when there is a conduct the next day, like an outfield or PT session. If not, you CAN get turned out in the middle of the night. Also when you are on outfield missions, there is no such thing as 7 hours of uninterrupted rest.

Side note if you happen to get posted to MIDS Wing (Navy), there is no lights out timing, cadets can spend the whole entire night studying - which is why MIDS wing has this famous saying of ""lighthouse"", because the lights never turn off in MIDS Wing.

The only time you get the 7 hours when outfield is during section/platoon training, or NAVEX (navigation exercises), where you manage your own time (though you have to report sitrep in the morning so you can't really just toh).

When your outfields turn into missions, there is no 7 hours. I fondly remember my Taiwan EX Starlight, in one of the many different exercises, a 5d4n outfield, the amount of continuous sleep at max is 2hrs - though I managed to get some shut eye during ""Stand-to"", prone and juz toh until someone kicks your leg. Mission appointment holders tend to only have at most 3hrs of sleep in the span of the entire 5 days.

Personally, as I have only been through Infantry OCC, the total amount of days I spent outfield (I actually counted) is 60 days. That is 2 whole months being out in the field as a trainee. This is not counting the time after you commission and become an officer, you will still have to go outfield with your unit - but it depends on what appointment and posting you get.

Shower and toilets are wayyyyyyy better than BMTC. This is because the structure of OCS is newer as it was built later than BMTC and that people take good care of the facilities there - reporting it quickly when they find damages. Area cleaning 100% is really 100% spotless kind, cadets are expected to hold the highest level of standard during standby area. You can even akin the toilets to being HOTEL level cleanliness when ready for inspection.

Regimentation wise, it is always held to the highest standards. Officer Cadets are really the LOWEST lifeforms in the SAF. You can expect the punishments to be very creative and can sometimes be very miserable, BMTC has the limit of punishments based on the IPS system, but in OCS the fuckening can last for longggggggg longgggg time. My friends from Sierra Wing describes their fuckening as the 45 minutes of hell - basically non-stop whacking in the training shed for 45 minutes. My platoon mate once got threatened by my instructor to write a 5000 words essay, each letter different colour for the platoon's fuck up - yeah, morale can get really low in OCS. You will see the good, the bad and the ugly in people in OCS. Comparing with your peers are always almost impossible and toxicity can exist in the highest levels like openly chatting shit about someone in the section/platoon/wing. However, the flip side is that you can also find brothers that care for people.

But like what my instructor once said ""you are experiencing this kind of pain and suffering right now, so those who are under you in the future won't have to suffer this kind of pain"".

My advice to you if you are looking to want to go to command school, ask yourself why do you want to be a specialist or an officer? You are expected to carry yourself throughout NS, people will look up to you for instructions and go to you all the time. You will need to juggle the expectations from the higher ups (OC, CO, etc.) as well as the wellbeing and welfare of your men (your PS, sec comms and men). Don't be an officer or a specialist for the wrong reasons - such as the higher pay or the prestige, because if you have the wrong motivations and when you discover it is all not butterflies and fluffy clouds, your NS experience will be very miserable.

P.S. Oh don't forget, after ORDing, your ORNS 10 years you will still have to do what your rank allows you to do. It is not just the 2 years."
Meanwhile scs is paradise compared to bmt and ocs
"Start:
It was a huge jump from BMT as we were like thrown into this institute and little to no instructions were pumped to us. We were instantly punished for SDM stuff and downed a lot on the first day. I can tell you that the whole damn platoon had really Low morale and we just wanted to leave. Many OOCed and it really made us quite tempted to do so too. Marching has to be on point, discipline is really like uptight, admin time sometimes is just really close to <1 hour per day. I think that in the beginning, what made me dread OCS was the discipline and how you will get punished for the smallest things because my instructors were super strict about the smallest things.
Facilities:
Everything is on point here, 7 hours is a must and the toilets here are Gucci. It’ll be a huge step up from BMT.
Service term:
The PT sessions here are essentially free, we can have back to back daily workouts and we will barely have like time to even rest up for the next conduct. It really makes you on the ball as fk as they can call you down anytime for anything. There are days where we would have tests, PTs and then lessons which made us really really tired. Some days you wake up and you ask yourself why are you still in this shitty place. Outfield is every 2 weeks and force prep is super super stringent here. We were mostly called down by some alarm and we have to pack everything according to the standardisation. In OCS, If one person fks up, the whole platoon gets it. The only thing that keeps you going is the people around you. In OCS, people are motivated af and you will get reeled into the good vibes and CHIONG also. You’ll eventually start laughing even when you get fked pretty badly. 
Excercises:
In OCS, we have excercises every 2 weeks
EX skylark/nightbird - navigation
EX cocoon - section fighting training 
EX centipede - section fighting assessment
EX dump in - platoon attack/defence mission
EX coyote  - urban ops training
EX relentless - navigation/jungle survival/fighting

(These are the major exercises)
The outfield here is objectively driven. For my wing, ALPHA WING (P2 121/20), it’s tradition to have Charlie mikes (continue mission) after some missions to train us mentally. For example, after centipede, we went up the bus just to wake up at Lim Chu Kang where we had to tactically March like 5km back and 1km before we reached the finishing line, we got sniper ambushed and had to transport casualties back, we then received  out wing formation patch where we are inoculated into alpha wing. Excercises are tough and many will suffer injuries, most commonly the knees, and many will Toh, but you just have to be mentally fit enough to keep pressing on.
Rounding it off:
Ngl OCS is tough, although not mentally and physically for me, the disciplinary part to me is really really stupid and I hate it. But after a few weeks, you will learn to just suck thumb and carry on, it really gets easier after that. The most important thing in OCS is your platoon mates, they will be the one to push you on. When you survive without 2 nights of sleep in EX dump in due to continuous digging or when you have to do 6 fire fights per day for 3 days straight, it really eats into your psyche and the only thing that pushes you on is the people around you. You will start loving and appreciating those back home and appreciating outside food. OCS tempers your mental resilience through shitty times. But push on really, it’s tough but it’ll be worth it. I didn’t stay for pro term as I got posted out, but the brotherhood in Alpha is something that I’ll never forget."

"http://officercadetschoolsingapore.blogspot.com/2015/01/preamblethis-post-is-one-that-is.html

This sums it up nicely.

My personal opinion is to go for it."
"First day the best day

Rmb pack your 10 pack"
"In a way, you don't really get to choose.  You actually get chosen.  and the initial lot of chosen ones will be place in enhance leadership batch.

Just serve BMT and be yourself, and your performance and peer interaction etc will determine which command school you will go to or non at all, and if OCS require that cadets only have 4 hours sleep, and the whole wing share 1 single shower cubicle..  They will shape and train you to adapt to the environment.  but of course, in reality, they make sure you have enough sleep, and feeds you really well, and facility really is very good.."
"I went through OCS in 2007. Not sure if anything has changed (i doubt it has) but AIR WING is really the easiest. I was in Hotel wing for about 2 weeks then the PCs asked us to ""express interest"" to join Navy or Air Force Wings. 

so the story goes that I was sent to Air wing.

Training was still shiong but compared to the other wings it was very relaxed.

 I remember using the computer in my bunk and eating my uncle toby fruit bar (not supposed to eat in bunk but no one cared in air wing) and we watched Golf Wing march the whole night. Damn poor thing. 

We actually got irritated that the noise downstairs disturbed our sleep. hahahaha

Navy wing was next to us and every morning they ring the fucking bell while we still lying in bed. 

Importantly, Air Wing used to book out on Friday night while the other wings booked out on Saturday. Sometimes if the instructors wanna be bastard, they can drag your book out time till Sat evening. Air wing really no such fuckery, friday night confirm will book out because Air Wing PCs (who were 2 NSFs during my time) also wanna go home. 

Basically, if you go to OCS, aim for Air Wing if you can."
"Just my two cents worth.

Facilities wise,OCS is good.they will drill into you that you are there to be grilled and trained as a commander
The training will really built up your real physical fitness and combat fitness.Tri service and Service term still ok.Once you hit Pro term,that is when your mental need to be strong.Just enjoy the journey if you do make.it to OCS. Pro term everything goes.hahaha. Turnout at 3 am in full battle order was a norm for us back then.haha But again,things may have change cause i was batch 37 year 1999. Was in Infantry vocation and was in Alpha Wing back then.Those days,they call Alpha Wing the Sadist Wing.hahahah. Instructors was super on and will drained you(physically and mentally).But it was all worth it.You came out stronger mentallly. All the best"
i see \~ thanks!
Ooo whats special about the bunks :o and the toilets are nice?
ahh i see... I assume you were posted as man? how do you think your experience compare to BMT?
One correction is that the 7 hours is mostly enforced. Refer to u/rayneraiku post for the breakdown where the 7 hours is not applicable. In my case staying up past lights out is a no go and we'll get F-ed for that. So it may actually be wing/company dependent
"depends tbh, if lucky can get posted to do admin jobs. even infantry can get posted to force protection squadrons etc. and basically zuobo for rest of NS but have to chiongsua OCS first"
regardless of whether I get command school or not?
Really? What about it is better?
thanks so much for your detailed response!! really helps me in deciding whether OCS is for me :)
*air raid sirens* ---> ptsd intensifies
HAHAHAHAHA thankss so much atb mannn
"What if you become officer then down pes, will you still keep your rank?"
What’s the 9th core value?
you only share a bunk with another person so only two cadets in one room. the toilet was an eye-opener to me after experiencing tekong cos rly q clean
"I was 04/20 batch, enhanced leadership. Honestly wanted to get to command sch but didn't happen so currently a combat medic trainee. Right now as trainee is so much slack compared to bmt even the pt conducts here are nothing, we do metabolic circuit without the jumping jacks between exercises. But different places may differ, I have sections mates saying some are quite shag having SOC etc. But I think if you get any combat fit vocation, you'll have to go through more training for the vocation, eg the medic course is 12 weeks long, other courses may differ so its basically bmt again but less strenuous and more studying here. Sleep wise is so much better than bmt, here we LP at 1900 LO 2230, between that is all admin time so you can sleep earlier if you want"
"ya FP pc is the best rly slack, even if go 8sit mainly do admin"
"everything. 

Training wise scs is shorter than ocs, personally I can’t imagine going through 9 months of intense training but ~4-5 months sergeant course for me was ok. 

In scs there are more opportunities for you to lead and train your leadership skills. As trainers are also prev batch scs cadets they know what you go through, and are mostly very friendly. 

In my term everyone gets to be a sect comm for a few weeks, some get chosen to be “oc” or “sm” to come up with the routine order, and plan for the day. In my opinion this really helps hone your leadership skills. 

Training wise found term you do normal infantry stuff, stuff like basic navi, cqb, sect movement etc then pro term you will specialise in your vocation training. 

However I went through scs during covid period so training was extremely dialed down, so maybe it was paradise only for that period lol

Don’t forget that 3sg rank privilege and pay :::D (I’m just kidding don’t cancel me)

What is air raid compared to thunder flash outfield

"ahh i see ive read somewhere that if i dont go command school, whichever vocation i eventually get mostly depends on manpower needs do you think its truee"
thank you for your reply hahahaha! May I know what vocations do ppl in SCS usually get? issit majority infantry? and what happens after you complete SCS you just doing the same thing as unit but with a higher rank right? or do all that complete SCS have to be a commander in BMTC first before going to their respective units?
"Haha just curious, I’m pes e and about to ord in 2 months :))))). So close but so far!"
"hmm but do you think if I'm posted to another unit and not go command school, life is generally less tough? Cos I'm pes B1 and may get posted to other combat units that can be equally tough hahaha im not too sure..."
Wow what they work as and how much they earn
"Idk man I have a life science background so makes sense I get medic, from my bmt section the 16 of us were like scattered all over so unless you're mono, you got chance to go almost anywhere"
"many many vocations, but those who end up in infantry are in the 20-30%. You work the ground, take care of men, have more responsibilities task wise. Officers give order, you execute them. But you will buddy with officers since you work with them 

Huh? No la in fact very little get posted back to Tekong. You can get posted to a lot of places/units wherever they need manpower"


ahh thankss!
"Oh ffs. 

Officer knock the Sgt down? In unit? 

Please don’t spread nonsense around."
"What kind of officers make sgts do corporal punishment sia? Sign extra etc, yes, but not push ups that kind."
one word. lepak
"Not combat fit, sergeant also cannot tekan. C9 no IPPT. So relax lah."
Canteen Break.
"4 weeks bmt, 5 weeks vocational training. Just relax. BMT will probably be the best part of your NS journey as a Pes C. After you're in your unit you'll miss kranji camp and the 4 hours per day you spend ironing bed and talking cock."
"80% chance you’ll be sent to CSSCOM or some other supply base. Life there is slack, nothing to do. Unfurl the cot bed cos you’ll be using it daily. Then again, you might be like me, the unlucky 20% who will be posted to combat units, like OCS or SCS. I’m posted in SCS, and it’s a tough life. You still have to go outfield, stay in, and work till 9pm. Sucks cos I did all I could to attempt to get stay out vocation at CSSCOM, but what to do? Suck thumb lor..."
Why leh? Can tell me more?
Why leh?
"eat, sleep, play, repeat"
Lets just say after 1 month of bmt u will get posted to support vocations like driver or airforce etc etc. You can search on9 for more support vocations
"What do you mean why leh? Its like someone say ""we are human"" and you ask ""why leh?"""
"I dont think PES has anything to do with camera phones haha, it rly depends on your job function, security zoning (green/red) and unit requirement/ enforcement."
"Regardless of PES, camera phones are allowed in any Green Zones, which should be most camps. Camera phones are only prohibited in Red Zones. It’ll usually be states which areas are red zones."
"This is a friendly reminder not to share any **confidential information** about a particular camp or base in posts/comments.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NationalServiceSG) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
"as others have said, pes has absolutely nothing to do with whether camera phones. If a zone is red zone, you are not allowed to have camera phones. but if it is green zone then yes allowed. regardless of pes status"
"Usage of camera phones are allowed if you are in Green Zone camps, not by your PES classification.

If you are entering Red Zone camp or ops room, you need to surrender and deposit in the lockers provided before you enter. If you are posted to a red zone camp, you might need to sandblast/remove your phone's camera if you do not have a spare non-camera phone.

Green Zone allows camera phones to be brought in but you are still not allowed to use the camera function (Any form of military/non military photos/videos taken inside the camp premises are also included)."
Depends on your sir/mdm
infantry
B2 is everything except the most xiong - commando and guards.
B2 no command school that’s for sure
"I thought pes b2 cant go combat vication. At most combat support like combat engineer, artillery etc"
8sir trooper maybe
Who say b2 cannot go?
"Im pes b2, my playoon sgt said normally cant go. If you do get it quite rare. Only 1 guy in my whole bmt coy got infantry trooper"
"Not sure if I should be posting this, but whatever 

NS is something most Singaporean men experience. I don't really think it's worth the questions you'll get for getting PES F from people in the future, and while the NS experience would not be one I would want to repeat, it's not really something to just escape either. If you really must though, there are various ways to get pes F, with basically none keeping your dignity intact or something you really want.

Ways include, getting cancer or any terminal illness, doing things which only insane people would do (such as repeatedly fapping in front of your superiors and commanders even after going DB), gain some mental issues (or fake having them and convince the specialists at IMH that you have them), get crippled, etc

Again, not recommending you do any of that. NS may not be as bad as you think"
"Drink lots of red bull to fake heart attack, take legit MCs which span several months, threaten to kill yourself in front of superiors. If you really want to get out of it you can, decision is up to you."

Some condition like Insomnia. And have doctors to back you up.

"Honestly, dont cause then you wont be entitled to benefits which NSFs get in the future especially if you plan on staying in Singapore"
"From their FAQ: ""A4.	All servicemen, regardless of PES status, will be eligible for selection to be 3-year or 4-year Cyber Specialists. PES A/B servicemen will not be eligible to be 2-year Cyber Operators.""

Do note that if you are selected, ur NS will last 3 to 4 years instead of 2.

You will need to sign a contract before enlistment if you are selected. That's when you know you are in."
What did the MO say to you? Did he at least refer you to the visiting psychiatrist?
">  have submitted my specialist memo by IMH 

Where/who did you submit it to?

> Are they taking my memo too lightly? 

No, despite what people like to say the Medical board doesn't take medical/mental issues lightly. They follow the protocol strictly so it might seem that way.

> I don't think I can handle firearms 

Not for you to decide, For Medical board to Decide.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't know what you wanted out of posting this. But if it's to ask

> Are they taking my memo too lightly? 

Answer is: No."
Pes system I think can be found on the cmpb website where they list it out with some info. Training wise I'm not sure other than some Pes you are basically excused from doing anything
"If i’m obese and have a back pain problem,which pes will i most likely go?"
"Depends on what the MO thinks at your pre-enlistment medical checkup.

Obese should be the BP I think

Back problems depends on how severe, could be anywhere from B to E."
"From what I hear from friends, if you're obese you'll go into the BP batch where you'll enter bmt 2 months earlier but the back pain problem need see the during medical checkup or if you got a specialist letter to be excused even better then they might give you up to Pes C9  or lower which excuses you from almost everything I believe. Best to check with the medical officer when doing pre enlistment checkup and get a specialist checkup for you back if needed"
Will the MO run through like a general checkup?E.g-check if high blood pressure or difficult to breathe etc
Will the BMT duration and intensity be the same as lets say PES A/B?And other trainings as well
"Basic stuff. They take your blood for blood test to check for blood diseases I assume. Height and weight. X ray of your torso (waist to shoulders, excluding arms). Colour blindness and sight test. Blood pressure, bpm, and cardiac dysrhythmia. And there's a 1 to 1 consultation where you the MO will checkup based on your declared injuries/problems. So make sure you state everything on the online questionnaire so they will know"
"Adding on to what the other guy said; if you happen to be seeing a specialist for your back problems, prepare and bring a specialist letter/memo to your pre enlistment medical and bring up the issue (and the letter) with the MO who's reviewing your medical."
"Duration depends. Majority is 2 months whereas BP is 4 months. Intensity may differ as some have reasons to be excused but majority should be similar. I heard that pes c9 is not even allowed to do physical activity without supervision, they were doing push ups in the bunk and got scolded when officer saw them. All these is based on my knowledge"
Any injections?
"Ah okay thanks for the heads up,may i know when is the medical checkup before enlistment?"
So pes BP training will be tougher since we are obese
Well they stick a needle in you to get the blood but otherwise no injections
"They should be sending you a letter soon with the date of your pre enlistment check-up I think. If you're not confident, you can call up cmpb and ask for more info."
I don't know for sure but from a fitness stand point it should be gradually getting harder as you become more fit. For example let's say starting run is 1km then it might increase to 2km after a month. But like I said im only assuming
"i pestered the staff at CMPB over and over again to enlist me as early as possible and they gave me what I wanted lmao, you should too"
hi may i ask what you said to them? and i’m assuming you did it through phone?
"Congrats bro, jackpot!

Working environment really depends on your immediate superior/boss, some of them can be very nice to NSFs, others are just douchebags. Just learn to suck it up and get used to it if u kena such people.

Things u can expect: Stay Out, 8-5.30 daily, great choices for food(no cookhouse, u can choose to go out for your lunch)"
Lucky AF
Thanks bro. 🙏 But it's kinda far for me I might want to request nearer camp such as khatib camp or nee soon camp but might not be apprived though let's see how it goes.  I'm currently pes e so definitely gonna be a clerk anywhere I go so your jack pot is referring to me being a clerk or because of cmpb hq has a better environment than other places?
"Thanks bro but I dun understand why ?? 😅

I'm a pes e clerk admin 
Excused stay in
Excuse uniform
Plus mo say I can only be admin

So do you suggest if being a clerk in a camp nearer to my house is better or cmpb?"
"You can disrupt your NS for the start of your University, wherein you return to serve your remaining service during your semester breaks.

&#x200B;

IIRC it's dependant on how you are as a soldier, and if your CO is willing to approve it.

For more info, ask your unit S1 about disrupting your NS when you post out after BMT (and when you have your placement in Uni already).

[CMPB page with basic info here](https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/web/portal/cmpb/home/before-ns/disruption-for-further-studies)"
"You're my mirror batch. I enlisted in Oct 3 2017, I'll ord on Aug 2 2019. It doesnt really affect tho unless you're somewhere in the middle of Oct. But if that's the case, you can always defer and serve the few days during your break."
"In that case, there’ll probably be no overlap since uni typically starts in mid-late Aug. Thanks!"
"—> stay out
—> ask to be transferred because too ulu

bruh you gotta give and take what you get. would you rather chiong for the rest of your two years?"
Well you have a point. Im just gonna suck it up then. I do hope the foods good tho atleast

Btw you asa too? The bus stop is the one that is just near mandai camp 2 right?

"yes, yes it is"
Oh damn sorry.
"If I rmb correctly they usually ask those with sweaty palms to step aside, might still do or might wear gloves. Vocations they might not put you with explosives."
"yes, yes and most likely no. grenade isnt a veto for pop for any pes and u shldnt be eligible for vocations such as pioneer which include explosives and ordnance handling. afaik for scholarships this shldnt impact your eligibility and u could always wear gloves if needed"
Sorry if this sounds rude but why were you excused and where was it stated becuase I have some hearing problems in my left ear and I was given b2 but there was no excuse for me
Thanks for the help man!!
"I have sweaty palms (hyperhidrosis).

When I'm nervous, my touchscreen won't detect my fingers. I also have issues at immigration because of the sweat. 

Its pretty shitty but I gotta live with it lol.

I think you can check your MC status via eHealth, under the MC section which is below your PES status."
Damn
"Damn, I’ve never heard of that, kinda wondering if I have something like that myself now. Hmm. Anyway, good thing they heard you out :)"
What do you want to know? Can PM me!
Go up the chain of command. You can try to report sick first though.
Ur CO have nothing better to do? Which unit are you at?
Go get referral to psychiatrist. Get things documented. Saf doesn't take things that aren't official
"A bit late, but better late than never.

Do yourself a favor and go to the A&E of IMH.  There's no point bothering with the chain of command as if your officer commanding really wants to, he could technically just pretend that you never did anything and ignore your request(s).  At this point, it's no longer about respecting military regimentation; it's about your wellbeing."
who is your CO?
Call MINDEF hotline if all else fails.
Sounds like malingering.
"While I don't recommend malingering, if you do have an issue you're concerned about, report to your MO or go to a polyclinic. If they find that there is a valid concern they will refer you to a hospital for further check ups."
"Enlisted into SCDF 6 weeks ago. PES B1 PTP. Training wise for PES C, shouldn’t be too tough. From what I heard, the PES C boys will be joining Bravo Company so expect the regimentation to be strict. Other than that there shouldn’t be anything to worry about."
"Vocations wise I don’t think there are many options available to you; admin, store that kind of stuff. The pay is $560, NSTI is quite okay actually despite being right beside the cemetery. If you’re scared just wake your buddy up when you want to go to the toilet in the middle of the night. And confinement is only one weekend, instead of two in the army."
"I got to walk around on an exercise with the P rail SAR21, it came attached with a bunch of extra attachments that had to do with a backpack computer. I had the chance to fire a P225 or P226? Can't remember which model. I was in 6SIR, but my CO was spearheading some special initiative and thus why we got a chance to use some of this non-standard stuff."
"If you undergo OCS or SISPEC, you are required to be trained in all weapon systems in a Platoon, namely the SAR 21, SAR 21 M203 variant, SAW, GPMT, MATADOR and in some cases, the P226 pistol. For the SAR 21 P Rails and Optical scopes, ADF has been using that variant prominently and I believe the Commando Units inclusive of SOF have been using them too."
"Recon trainees gets to use AR-15, replacing sar21"
GPMG gunner in reservist here. Never trained with it during NS. But I was able to pick it up quickly during ICT AND  got stuck with it.

Yet another bright-eyed recruit that hasn’t yet seen what the SAF has to offer.
Big ambitions bro
"No, its just a giant populartity contest anyways, the winner will never be the most deserving."
"No, my company best got silver"
What you mean?
"Basically, people like you who say they want to be company best and go OCS etc before ever experiencing bmt."
And how would you know I'm not in the middle of bmt? Or do people like you enjoy underplaying other people's goal and throwing yourself pity parties?
"Just an innocuous comment based on past experience, but sure, feel free to get offended."
"Depends on your coy. If cant, just dont get caught. Best if you're platoon 4, easier to secretly buy."
"Looking at your previous comments, you have already POP’ed. So why still ask these stupid & redundant questions ?"
"Anything also can do, just don’t get caught lo"
"Nope, unless given permission by their Sgt"

How wouldn’t I not understand? I enlisted 2 months ago and you don’t see me asking on this subreddit relatively stupid questions such as if it’s ok to hand wash my clothes in camp. This is new level of idiocy but oh well.
5D4N might just be the duration of the outfield. There is still recovery process such as cleaning equipments and arms. So might bookout on Saturday if all goes well.
Okay thank you!! :)
"Go to your superior after you get posted to vocational school. Whilst you are able to claim back the leave if you take MC during your leave, i’m not sure if that applies to block leave."
When did you enlist? I doubt you'll get one day off cause its on your block leave.
Highly unrecommended unless you want to give off a bad impression to your superiors - it is block leave just leave it
it’s 670+175 totaling for 845. am currently an scs cadet in pro term
Should be 720 because no vocation yet
pro term and found term same pay?
also isn’t the base allowance for scs cadet 720 now
With vocation?
depends on vocation still. but i’m in MP so the vocation pay is the same as foundation term
that includes the 50 base vocation allowance everyone gets. i separated the vocation allowance and the rank pay
Then add voc pay la
oh so u also got 845 during found term?
well mine FT was before the pay increase but during FT i received 750 which was rank pay + vocation pay. since the pay increase it will now be 845. this is because in FT your vocation allowance is considered combat support.
Oh .. okok thanks :-)
Well a month back I had a conduct with C4I military experts and yes one of them was pes C9 so I believe it is possible. He was a me4 cadet as well.
"I'm in a CSSCOM unit and I know quite a few regulars that are PES C9 under the ME scheme. Although I'm not too sure about promoting to officer through the scheme, since none of the ME4 and up (basically CPT equivalent and above) that I know are combat unfit."
"If you are set on signing on, you can choose to up pes. If you declare interest in signing on and your reason for pes C is quite mild, SAF can try to see if they can up oes you."
"My friend is E9 and he signed on C4i, and yea he’s ME"
"All PES can sign on C4X which is ME scheme. You’ll go to OCS and get ME4-T rank I believe (or OCT), and excused the things you can’t do due to health concerns but still pass out commissioned."
Hello! Thanks for the reply! This is really helpful; I will go and look more into this as an option.
"That's dependent on a degree, no?"
"Hello! Thanks for the reply. Hmm, I’m sure that holding a degree allows for one to go straight to ME4-T, but nonetheless I will read it up more, thanks again!"
"Hello! Thanks for the reply. I do see upping PES as an option, but I have several considerations as well.

1) If I up Pes now, I will have to re BMT and my two years will reset (wouldn’t matter if i wanted to sign on, but better to err on the side of caution)

2) I’ll have to wait for a few months for medical board to get back to me which is something I’m not really keen on as I’ll be stuck nowhere here or there (continuing what I’m doing as a C9)"
"Hello! Thanks for the reply. Wow, this is a first and will definitely interest my E1 and E9 friends. Thanks so much!"
"Hello, thanks for the reply! I have no excuses at the moment, and this reply really helps because it does sound like I will still be able to go through what many combat fit people can in C4X if I’m keen 🤔"
"Yeah, but OP said he was gonna get one so I mentioned it. Although I think they do have to go through some form of OCS to get ME4, which might give problems for him."
"If you're already an NSF, your ORD can't be shifted. I have seniors who re bmt four months before they ORD, after their POP they went back to unit to serve one more month before ORD."
"Basically no IPPT and SOC/VOC, no ATP if you didn’t do BTP. I think C4X scheme doesn’t automatically come with degree funding, although you can “combine” it with one of SAF’s scholarships. Degree not a must I believe but it affects pay"
"There is a minimum term of engagement for both officers and specialists. If you enter OCS/SCS normally (i.e. straight from BMT), your length of service should not be different from your batchmates. However, if you OOC and recourse OCS/SCS on the other hand, you might face a situation whereby you'll need to VES (voluntary extension of service) to pass out from your course."
"Everyone has 10 cycles of ICT (10 years of reservist)   
Non officers do 10 cycles or turn 40 years old, whichever comes first. Officers age limit is 50."
KAHs need to complete 13 cycles. Everyone else is 10 cycles.
"Short Answer: No.
SCS requires combat fit and a certain ippt standard. They being said, there are still such things as admin specs, although I dont really know how to get it. Being pes c usually means that you will get posted to a non combat role after pop."
C4i specs but you need be top 10% of ur cohort
"If you achieve the top 10% in some vocational courses (admin, supply, transport) you can receive a 3rd SGT rank."
"Not for supply and transport, only asa can. Top 10 go become spec trainer for future asa batches OR pass interview to be come paracounsellor P.A, free 3sgt also

This only applies to vocational training during pes c/e bmt"
"Depends really, what’s your vocation?"

"Post to unit, wait for driver course. While waiting for driver course do Sai Kang. Finish driver course, become a driver."
what is saikang?
"Literally translates to “ shit jobs “, basically stores, admin whatever ad hoc nonsense jobs your superiors need help with. Part and parcel of ns tho."
the saikang stay in or stay out?

"storeman,driver, asa are very common vocations"
"Considering signing on also. U mono armour ? My buddy also got offered the work study diploma, to me it seems not bad. 3-4 yrs to complete NS, get diploma, get hands on experience and working at the same time."

Work study diploma which is from ITE/Poly is it? Go ahead if you wish to take up the studies and advance in the career. too bad for me i was rejected by them few days ago.
"I am an AFEM in 9AELG doing non-AC stuff, so if you go AC side, it will be different

1) ME1-1 to 1-2 is given, takes about 1 year due to its criteria of time in rank, but 1-2 to 2-1 is something you have to work hard for since you are competing with all the 1-2s

2) For me, my work here is mostly chill, spend most of our time doing secondary appointments, primary appointments only when we have system faults that we need to attend to, or to do some analysis of the faults. If you are thrown to a new system, then good luck, everyone is just slightly more knowledgeable than you in the system

Culture wise for my side, air force is very safety focus, we will pause works if there is just a near miss (almost accident but never kenna). My seniors are quite helpful and the commanders are quite friendly and they recognises who are putting in work. But when you enter unit, be prepared to study up on your system since that is your primary appointment, if cannot answer just say I cannot confirm let me go look it up. System stuff try not to smoke so much, don't know just say, chances are the person asking you also don't know. Be proactive about learning different skills, and see if you can use the skills you learn put toward innovation since air force is very much into innovation nowadays. If vou able to, your write up will be quite postive.

3) Yes, but i have not gone on any overseas attachment yet, my seniors gone for like 2 weeks for exercise.

4) This one i cannot comment."
mono 1sir bro
WSDIP minimum 3 yrs right ?
woah thats cool bro. mind telling me what type of questions were asked because im pretty nervous for the interview
most probably from ite and do you mind sharing me what went down during the interview?
thank you so much for this response!!! really answered my questions and i really appreciate it

"I took a MAPAS test at cmpb but i tot it might be for future vocation since i in mono intake . Supposedly to do Interview at cmpb after pop but they told me that i didnt pass the requirements so i enquired with SAF side becos i also choose SAF , so they told me this MAPAS test might have to do something with AF. 

Just a note that i am a ex graduate for ITE TED Diploma and they still have trouble accepting TED as a diploma so they will take ur Highest Qualification which is Higher Nitec and you will be posted as a airforce technician and you might earn lesser but since they are willing to take in WSDip from ITE then shldnt be a problem for you."
thank you! ill try my best !!
What's the mapas test? I'm also going for the wsdip In RSAF interview next week.
"The same test of what u did for ur NS Check up.
I believe RSAF is looking at ur mapas test because i believe i didnt do well thus they did not accept me.

Update : i have been accepted as a regular for SAF maintenance unit."
Btw can I ask what questions did they ask you for the interview?
"I am not so sure... mine was applied at the talk, if u are selected then they will interview u imo."
"Muslims can keep keep their mustache, but not beards. Mustache must also be properly maintained. However all depends on OC, if no means no, I have heard of someone getting getting a letter from MUIS for an excuse and he got it. 

Muslims in the army tend to be close-knit, depending on your company. My company in BMT required Muslims to go to a different cookhouse for Muslim food and needless to say, the entire Muslim recruits will march there, along the way you tend to make friends from other platoons which otherwise you wouldn't meet if you weren't Muslim. 

You will miss prayers if you are not careful with your time. There will certainly be enough admin time to do prayers, but asar time is the easiest to miss due to PT/Training. Had a really religious dude who prayed even in outfield. 

Generally, do know that your commanders may not be muslim, so you will need to explain to them everything if need be. They tend to be more compromising on religious matters but please don't take it for granted and get your obligations done as soon as possible. 

You will meet people from all walks of life, the good and the bad. Don't be a burden and your nsf life is literally easy, everybody is tired at the end of the day and they could care less about you unless you're giving them trouble"
"If you keep deferring because of studies, no one has the right to say anything or create some sort of suggestion to the actual people in charge that you will get into a ""shit"" unit. Unless, of course you are just using every chance to escape for a little bit more civilian time.

It's just a matter of luck a lot of the time especially if you will be one of those who let the system roll the dice for them like most people. My brother sort of changed his own fate by going through the commando selection process before he enlisted but even then you can drop out among other things. 

I am enlisting soon and I feel that even if I'm unlucky by getting a shitty vocation, I think the people you meet and the officers you are under play a very big role into whether it really is a ""shitty"" unit on the inside if you know what I mean."
">I'm of the opinion that the beard for a muslim is obligatory

I adhere to the Shaffie school of thought in Islam, which is the most common among Malay Muslims in Singapore, and I have not heard of this rule at all. Do you adhere to a different Islamic school of thought?"
if indian muslim get scdf/spf or some infantry unit almost always
"Have you seen uniformed personnel keeping beards?
No because it's not allowed, moustache can but can't be beyond the lips.

For prayers if you have free time then can go but it's not guaranteed. Can't always allocate time in the schedule for a group to pray. And don't abuse it if you're given time to pray."
"My friend deferred from ite as a cdo, post poly still cdo, so is very random."
"im guessing since commandos very small, they can agak2 who the in charges will be? Hence why they know the kind of people who will be in charge of your deffered unit?

I agree the commanders play a big role. I heard of NS stories where the platoon sergeants don't even shout at the platoon and they really respected him. Hope you and i get sergeant like that haha"
"Official position of Shaffis is beard is recommended, other schools and alternative Shaffi opinions say it's obligatory."
"We don't actually have to stick to one madhab for every particular rule/hukum. When we do our research about each imam's understanding and opinion regarding an issue, especially the state of the hadith, we can sort of ""tell"" which one seems to be the strongest and more secure opinion. (tell isn't a good word. my vocab not so good)

In this case, i think imam hanbali's opinion is strongest regarding the beard"
they scared we radicalise then use their training against them or what?
"No... Not at all. My brother busted his ass and he is still busting his ass for his unit. In fact, from what he tells me, his higher ups are all amplified versions of any other unit's most strict and demanding higher ups.

I would say it depends.. It is actually really obvious when someone in charge does not know how to be in charge and also does not take care of their men properly. Like already mentioned in this thread, you will meet the good and the bad but it is mostly the bad that make it unbearable and define the unit itself as shitty, not the unit's work because actually pretty much every vocation has its' own set of challenges."
Out of curiosity... why need to keep beard?
"yea they scared when war with malaysia, some of us go to the other side

its a retarded reason but it is what it is, im in scdf my bro from some unit in army no one even really knows about

you see how many malays/muslims in navy/air force/signals tells you all you need to know already,  sg racist as fuck when it comes to ns"
Dang how bad just how bad is ur brother commanders like got examples/stories
"Religious aspect, the prophet commanded us to keep the beard according to some reports. Also to refrain from looking like the fire worshippers who shave the beards and keep the mustache.

Health wise, it keeps outer particles from entering your nose, much like how your nose hair filters out dust and other particles from entering your system, the beard is a bigger extra filter

Decreased chances of facial issues such as acne, etc. The beard retains moisture in the face.

psychological aspect, people tend to trust men who have beards than those who don't.

Lastly, beards are exclusive to men and only women don't have beards. Not to mention a soldier with a beard is badass as hell!

(learn more about health benefits of beard from youtube video titled ""health benefits of beards"")"
"when were you enlisted? I know it doesn't really matter as it's also not confirmed i will enter, but i was invited for commandos vocational assessment and saw a few malay guys too. But actually they also had a questionnaire regarding religion though. So i think they'll keep a lookout for the guys that are religious. It's the paper you get when you first enlist to BMT. I think the officer/commander paper. Got few questions regarding religion"
The best example is how much shorter his weekends are compared to others. He only gets like one and a half days to be at home. Other people in other units get 2 days and sometimes slightly more.
"last year april


 commando not really a sensitive unit tho, it has few malays but indian muslim quite rare, its just xiong af not what i would consider a sensitive unit, they are just infantry on steroids"
Wtf why tho??
"If my highest education is ITE, does it impact whether i go CD or army? I think I'd rather army than CD. CD sounds like a lot of hard work and claustrophobic"
"yea i think you have a higher chance of gg cd, we do have the most ite cert holders no offence. if u go army probably get mono infantry which is dog life pretty much"

Can any vocation one. I thought I B1 will kanna infantry but got rsaf
What ya mean by security clearance is Cat 2A and above
"PRs, as far as I understand, can’t go into either the RSN or the RSAF."

"Ah didn't know that.

Well he wouldn't want rsaf anyway"
Alright thanks
I would wanna go rsaf
"This toxic narrative really needs to stop. As long as you served the 2 years of NS, you will not be disadvantaged in any way."
"Ya. When i go buy a HDB, they ask for my pes status and what i did in my ns. Did i shoot my guns well? Am i gold for IPPT? Did i stole someone's snack during field camp? Did i cheat the quiz that they told us to do?"
"Like the other redditors have commented, PES E9 does not equate to you being a 2nd class citizen. Your PES Status does not affect you in any other way outside of the army. As a PES E9, likelihood of getting called up for reservist is usually close to 0% unless there is a shortage of manpower. PES A to PES E9 gets the same amount of privileges as long as you served your nation as an NSF for 1 year 10 months to 2 years.

That being said, if you are PES F, that is a different story as the service transcript shows the incompletion of full-time national service. PES F is the true ""2nd class citizen"" as labelled by many. Some problems a PES F will face is like you said HDB, school, employment in public sector etc. This is because of the underlying problems that renders him to be unable to serve full time NS, which usually warrants an explanation."
"Yeah it does matter, my brother just bought a BTO, they asked if he got marksman and his rank. Oh yeah and his IPPT results too and whether he kena pump during BMT"
"yeap rank definitely matters outside of ns, /s"
"School, wont affect. HDB I not sure but who can afford them anyway"
That’s the same as my bro!!
Is this legit?
Thank you for your reply!
HDB ask your brother to knock it down first before he is allowed to ballot
you stupid or stupid
"They forgot the /s, issa joke lah"
"He pumped 20 and was asked to crunches changes push up change, prone roll change"
So want to confirm
Okay thank you so much
"NCC HQ, easiest 3SG"
"I am posted to STS as supply supervisor As supply Sgt. But the course there is super long, found term is easier but dreadful, as long as SCS FT, then another one month training, den posted out for 4 months On job training, den go to Kranji camp 1.5 month for Pro term. U will get private pay all along and u do Sgt course shit until pro term then u can scs pay. Not worth. So I ooc from sts. Now temporarily admin clerk"
So cadets who ooc scs found term without down pes will likely post here?
how long does it take be 3sg
"pls don’t spew nonsense, most of those in NCC HQ got posted there coz they OOC from infantry pro term. even then, it’s a long shot..

TS, PM me if you want more info 

source: ex scs cadet"
U ooc from scs ft? Why?
"usually, or will be posted as CQMS"
I think in the end PES F is a big decision and likely will require medical board with you in present and an SAF specialist. Don’t think it ultimately matters whether public or private specialist memo.
"for me i was assigned from saf to govt hospital doc (took 1-2 months - pes E1 at the time) took another 2 months for the govt doctor to ask my MO to send me for med review at med board and took another 2-3 months before I see the MMI doctor for the review (though I saw 2 in the room - not sure if they were both docs or one was clear and the other doc) and another 1-2 months to be officially PES F'd by the medical board.

government bureaucracy at its finest, you need the doctors to be on the ball and hope there isnt a big queue. but generally govt is fine i never spent a penny on private since i was a poor recruit"
"If you are asking a medical question, please ask your MO. They will be able to give you an accurate answer.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NationalServiceSG) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
"They both hold the same power. Govt route just takes longer and they’re very quick to classify your ailments as non chronic because they don’t spare provide all the resources to make a proper diagnosis. I once requested for an mri to a specialist in sgh. He literally just shouted at me “you will never get an mri! You only get one if you’re dying!” That’s when I knew private was the only option. Wasted 7 years on Govt route and suffered in every ict. Private took 3 mths and with medical board, I got downgraded in 6 mths."
Cause I have heard people saying private specialist are less reliable because they can be bought with money to write fake reports
Can I pm u?
"Yep, that’s the more overriding feeling. If public hospital with no money-benefits for writing memo, they might trust a bit more."
Sure
I see thank you
to see which dum dums get sent to die first
Factors into your vocation posting.
give u false hope
Nope! Both are different organisations
ask CPT Levi
"No, because you'll need to do SAF BMT.

I don't think SPF and scdf trainees can post out after basic training. I only know SAF trainees can go to home team after BMT."
Bro serious you from real police want to join “fake” police
"Damn that's unfortunate, thanks for the reply!"
The only fake police is NPCC lmao
"Both are ""real"" police, except they govern different areas. Don't make stupid comments you have no knowledge of"
"Sign on if you want MP. SPF pay is better though, with more off days"
bro spf is better. also u become an infanteer for ict once u ord as mp
maybe same bed
"I don't know about chances but you can't ask to be in the same platoon or not. It's same as a school, you can't ask the teachers to place you and ur friends in the same class just because you want to"
"Depends on enlistment date, time and also luck. And even if y'all lucky enough to be same section or platoon etc. U need to be lucky enough to be same voc aft u pop lmao"
"Btw,will we be seeing each other often? Only for the first 4 week?"
No
"Outdoor, it’s those games u play in primary school like tag"
Have a back injury
Pm
Pm
"Depends. They may forward this to your unit so that during reservist you will just have to see your OC to be charged. The OC will decide the level of punishment, starting from verbal reprimand to a fine."
Yes. From there they will tell you where and when to report. Either CMPB or your unit HQ where a Junior Disciplinary Officer will charge you. It's best if it is handled within your reservist unit because the punishment metted out seems to be more lenient compared to the officers outside of your unit 
"If they did not forward this to my reservist unit, they will send a letter to me right? "
How long is the rt window?
"Most likely no. Block leave entitlement is only for those who pop.
When you get to your unit check with your unit if you can take leave during that time.

On the positive side, in unit usually u can plan your leave according to your needs with approval from your superior.

Check with your unit. "
"I'm not too sure but I don't think so.

&#x200B;

# To be sure, check with your S1 or your PS.

&#x200B;

Either way, if you aren't allowed to join your batch mates for block leave, you aren't exactly losing out. Sure they all get to run around for the period of the block leave, but you get to use the days as you wish (well, within the approval of your superiors) instead of it being locked in to the block leave period."

"Since their POP is quite far away, it is unlikely that you will still be without a unit by then. However, if it does happen, you'll have to report to your company line during the block leave until your posting arrives. Usually book in morning, bookout by evening and you'll just rest in the bunk the whole day. 
"
"Yes, apply to CMPB asap. It should be stated in the enlistment notice you received how to contact them should you need to defer"
"if i defer till july 6th am i guaranteed to get october intake or could it just be way after ?

&#x200B;"
Honestly it depends. Usually they try to enlist you asap. 
Either that or they forget about you for a year... FeelsBadMan
"Not sure fully..but I know that you have to go to ITE for some of the courses ie pest management.

The outline of the course if disease and outbreak prevention. "
"You need help, period.  You're right in that you're not thinking straight, and the last thing you want is for you to harm someone and potentially end up in jail for your actions.

However, seeing that there's no use complaining to your superiors now that someone (presumably one of your superiors) has told you that ""\[you cannot\] report sick outside"", my advice for you is to just not give a damn as to what your superiors say and seek the help you need (yes, I'm telling you to skip the chain of command).  Your own mental wellbeing is more important than what someone else says about you ""malingering""; if they want to keep up with the latter and berate you for seeking the help you need, get your parents involved or even your doctor(s).  Have your parents call your company's hotline and complain about their refusal to let you take care of yourself, or if you're visiting the medical officers, provide them with the contact information of your psychiatrist if they have a problem.

I know this isn't much, but **please, please** don't do anything stupid in the meantime.  I'm sure you've heard this many times before, but National Service only takes up two years of your life, and there's a long, bright future ahead of you after this shithole; you don't want to jeopardize that by doing something illegal."
"Firstly, the SAF takes mental issues very seriously. (Or at the least, by GOM they are bound by law to.) If you can't speak to your PSes about this, go to the next level. If you can tahan speaking to your Encik, **SPEAK UP ASAP.** If not, go to your PC ASAP.

**IF POSSIBLE, CALL UP/MEET UP WITH YOUR OUTSIDE PSYCHIATRIST AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ASAP.**

Secondly, your PSes usually don't care about that shit; they can't do anything about you since you have medical leave, which is almost irrefutable unless they launch a full investigation. Which in your case, since it's genuine, they will find you innocent.

&#x200B;

Don't push your luck thinking, ""Oh, I can tahan; no problem.""

By the time you realise you can't, it's too late. 

Get help, if it comes to it you'd be discharged from the SAF on medical grounds; this is not weakness, it is just life and for your safety (and wellbeing).

# SEEK HELP ASAP"
Maybe tell the MO Or your sergeants about your mental issues. Or get your psychiatrist to write a letter in to the office about your mental health
"Going to add on to this:

If you have a superior you think you can trust, doesn't have to be your PS or PC, another platoon's PS or PC also can if you feel you can't trust yours, tell them that you are having these issues and that you need help. At the very least, they should help you get in contact with SAF resources which can help. At best, they can talk to your PS, PC, OC, or whoever and discuss ways that will benefit you more, be it a down pes, getting you in contact with a counsellor, etc. Don't be afraid to speak up."
"1. you will take a pic with your fam
2. you will handover your ic and get ur 11b + saf ezlink card and some other stuff
3. you will be escorted to a room with a batch of peope where u will wait
4. after waiting, you will do some admin and learn some stuff
5. you will be escorted to the hall
6. take your oath and pledge
7. go eat
8. bye bye to parents"
Check out the guide to BMT on /r/Singapore. At the sidebar.
"Adding on to what u/KrimKarma said, after your parents leave, you will be brought to your bunk, where you put on your bedsheet/pillowcase etc. Followed by collecting the equipment issued to you by the SAF (1 bigass duffel bag + 1 field pack if you are Pes C). You will bring everything up to your bunks where your sergeants will then do an equipment check to make sure you have everything and also let you try on the clothes and boots/cap to exchange for different sizes if you need. After that it's just dinner and then free time until lightsout at 2200ish."

"Hey I’m enlisting on 17th too, have you received a packing list ? I’m still waiting and have to turn to online to see what to bring on enlistment..."
yeap also +1 assault pack
Nope haven't received any packing list letter yet tho.
"Enlisting on the 16th, didn't you receive the letter that has the green paper with the invitation to the parent engagement session? The packing list is behind it(the one which shows the location of the camp)."
They issue assault packs to PES C now? I rmb it was sling bags..
"Wah gg man... I think just check on the forum and bring what previous batches/bmt people bring before.

Are you looking forward to it ?"
"Ya just saw, thanks man ! All the best for your enlistment and see ya around !"

nah PES C and E only get assault packs
Tbf im actually quite nervous and not sure what to expect since it will be different than what the peepd in tekong experience.
C9!
"Same ah, although what I heard and seen from the parent engagement session sounded good and seems like quite ok, I think too good to be true leh, LOL..

What’s your pes status, I’m C9."

"Oh yes i too went for the parent engagement session there was this commander(i cant rmb the rank) who made some magic trick with a bell and jokes around. Seems too nice of a commander to be true hahaha.

Im C2, do you have any excuses? I heard that theres some lucky(?) individual who gets the stay out excuses tho"
Hoho! See you! From what I heard its most likely we are in the same company while the 17th May one will be in the other company Sch V has.
"Oh boy..hahaha, I remember sia, there was 2 parents and 1 incoming nsf who went up when he asked for volunteers, hahaha, he also jokingly ‘tekan’ the guy, rip sia..

Yeah, I have a chronic skin condition, but on the portal, it’s only my pes status, no excuses like stay-in or out, I doubt my condition is serious enough to stay out, so suck it up, but I hope to catch up on some studying or reading during NS, maybe think about Uni or smt."
Other company is Bravo company ?
"Ahh same here, no stay out excuses too and yes hopefully for the 2 years of NS i can get some studying done, been meaning to learn some foreign language.

Anyways see ya on 17th, who knows maybe we are put into the same company or platoon"
Yass.
"Yeah man, hahaha, we can definitely gleam something from this experience, ultimately it’s what we choose to make of it that matters, so let’s make it count ! 

See ya on 17th man, hahaha, we might be, we won’t know, but let’s go in with an open mind and see where it takes us !"
"lol, that's funny.

You'll get posted out no matter what. Your future depends on your PES status there after."
"Yes it's true that if you're on mc and your post is delivered to your coy, you won't be posted out. This is because 1, you're not physically there to be posted out and 2, units don't want personnels who are currently still on mc. 

You however will be posted out at some point so no worries there, just that the timing can range from weeks to months at the point of which you ooc/oot. This is most likely dependant on if your coy even sent out requests for post out which they most likely did, (you will know if they sent out requests if fellow oots are being posted out) or just demand is quite low at the moment.

For now, just tahan with the saikang or lepak lepak depending on your coy and wait. Good luck on your posting!

Source: was former ooc who actually got posted out after my coy pop because I was on 2 months mc for a surgery I did during bmt."
"It's been 3 months and there has been no posting and also one month no one got posted out. What's wrong with my coy, all the OOTs were confused."
How long after u come back from your MC did you get posted out?
Has ur coy POPed?
"When I came back from my hospilization Leave (2 months), my coy already pop 1 month ago. So it was really just me and 1 more guy waiting in bunk at coyline for a post out. I think I only waited for 1 and a half weeks before I got posted out. Hope this helps. But the guy waiting with me was already waiting for 1 month and still no news. So in the end, it all comes down to luck and your pes status"
8-Jun
Almost 3 mths not 3mths btw
"U'll get ur vocation after ur coy POP. Since you did not complete BMT, it will not be a combat vocation at the moment. Depending on your final PES after all the checks, you'll in the end re-BMT, go for the PES C BMT or go for the ASA course when the course starts."
Meaning what?
Meaning u most likely won't be posted out until ur coy POPs
"If they say minimum pes is XXX and you're going to downpes below XXX, then yes you will revocate."

Yes ASA tues and Thursday is whole day Lecture. Have some admin time if lesson end early though"
Yep! However swimming will be in Kranji Camp III instead of Khatib Camp


You in this batch of Charlie?
"Platoon 2, under Sgt Had-ji-so right ? Ahahaha

Good luck man, the lectures are different because, it’s vocation training once you finish your training in bravo. Your first 4 weeks is basic military stuff, firing, throw pineapple, etc. 

If you enter Charlie coy, you have lectures pertaining to ASA or SA stuff, but you still have foot drills, marching, because they wanna prep you for GP."
Asa related

Section 3 boi?
"Depends on when the next intake is, you can check on cmpb website. Can be a week to a few months"
There is intake next week but after that there is no date in sept or oct . Will they give me one of the dates next week?
Possible but rare to give the letter this late. Just wait it out
"4) Yes can, I even brought my ATB in"
"1. Think its an average size camp compared to others. Small compared to airbases and navy bases definitely.

2. The cookhouse is operated by SATS. In my opinion the food’s pretty okay especially during lunch time. Not so good during dinner tho.. But i guess you can always eat at the canteen. The malay store and the chicken cutlet at ABGTC cookhouse canteen is pretty good. And its very near the guardroom too.

Can’t answer the rest, but please do not bully when hoto duty from the guard duty personnels ;) enjoy your your stay in gedong cos its the most miserable place on earth

Depends if you lost your tooth in camp/ otw to camp/ during book out etc. Alot of factors involved

Dental implant. no.
actually i havent ns yet.

Thanks!
"If you don’t choose NDU, Commando or Guards during your vocation choosing, from what I’ve seen, they don’t send you there. I’m not sure about other vocations but they will try to place you in your preferred vocation unless they really need more men."
kranji camp 2 is not a red zone. there's even a free wireless@sg wifi there

bro thought i already explained LOL
Excuse everything and get pes f

Minimum use of hands should be fine. But if asked to carry heavy stuff my fingers will have wider cut and bleed more.
Not that I’m unable to serve the army. Still can post me out at least to ASA
the heavy stuff you will be carrying throughout your bmt are just your duffel bag and sar21 rifle (if you're not excused arms/heavy load)
ASA need to type. Doesnt that make ur hand bleed
"Don’t pes f, 2nd rate citizen bro"
"Given the condition is still good, my fingers can probably still survive. But if it goes back to worse then yes, even typing will make it bleed (happened during my poly intern)"
Won’t and never. Would prefer OOT and be clerk as commented by someone below. But unsure if possible
Well logically speaking just go get excuse everything and try to complete the 2 months. Then its just stay out clerk life everyday and u can wear gloves when using the keyboard
Get memo from specialist or doctor then show to your camp mo.
Is that possible? Because even if I go NSC now my skin condition now is still good.
But didn’t want to recourse lol
You can try bringing gloves and wearing it during the activities if u cant get excuse? Thats the only solution i can think of.
"Yep, totally possible. Im a pr chinese national and had the misfortune of being posted to guards"
I know of an PR who was posted to guards as a platoon medic
"Guards can, Commando cannot."
"For commando VA they will call you up via a letter maybe about 4 months prior to your enlistment letter.

You will go to hendon camp and perform a series of activities: namely balancing, static exercises ie. sit ups, push ups and pull ups, and then interview."
No.
why do you consider it to be unfortunate? just curious
"oh okay, thank you!"
"Chiongsua harder than infantry but get same pay. Regulars all super siao on, resulting in nsfs suffering under them. Oh and GCC/GVT + BRUNEI. I assume you want to come in because of the 'pride' factor?"
I just really want to push myself out of the comfort zone. I read about the things one does in guards and it seemed more rigorous and intense which was quite appealing to me.
"Ah i see, well you'll get plenty of opportunities to 'push yourself out of the comfort zones' in ns (sometimes too many) regardless of what vocation u end up as! But that's a really positive atititude you carry, not many people go in with that mindset. Atb to your ns journey!"
Just ask your MO.
Still mc and tmr gonna see doc again due to my condition got wrist so hoping I can have some ways of knowing what I can expect from the mo
"Broke my foot in NS and It's very standard for you to request a memo from your specialist, especially if you tell them you are in army. In that memo the specialist can indicate to give you X amount of time to rest and they are usually quite lenient. You will then pass this memo to your MO and they will guarantee follow that memo because it's a directive."
Got memo from the hospital doc mostly just state rest more eat what and what not and my mo is not those lenient one 1 time he put 1 guy for light duty but that guy still want to join back his squad for training go see specialist to say he fit from leg injury end up the doc pissed from his action and straight down pes him. So now I was curious about it due to I have a specialist appt a month from now not sure what verdict will he give .
"what the MO did there is understandable if that guy injury is legit one. cuz go outside u can easily beg the specialist to write whatever in the memo cuz outside ppl very kind. but in SAF if you get injured AFTER the MO give you a status then MO gonna get slaughtered by higher up.

so for your own memo the specialist just say get more rest? didnt indicate what type of rest? eg. light duty/excuse upper arm etc.? anyway dont worry so much, if specialist say need to rest then MO bopian need to follow one. SAF very strict safety now. Tell him also you still got follow up in August then even more he will understand your condition is not fully recover yet"
I hope spf  mo is same as saf mo regarding safety and well being of the trainee health
"Elaborate pls. I don't even know what the video is for or what is it roughly about, how to give u ideas on how to make a video.

With your post I can only tell u to take video edit and wah lah magic."
