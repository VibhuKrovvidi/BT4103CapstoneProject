I’m currently at the start of my National Service, enlisted on 2 April to BMTC School V but was sent home due to circuit breaker. Because of this, I’m having difficulty gathering the necessary information I need for a potential army career.

I spoke to my section commander over videocall a few days back about the possibility of signing on, and from what I gather from him, the only possible route I can take will be the Military Expert scheme because I am not combat fit and therefore wouldn’t qualify for officer scheme, and because I will be starting a degree in 2022, WO Spec will not be suitable as well. Just to do a fact check, can I really sign on as an ME as a C9?

A little bit more background; I was downgraded by the MO back when I did my checkup as I have mild eczema and childhood bronchitis. Nothing more than that. When I had my one to one interview with my PC, he was equally taken aback because the downgrade might’ve been a little too drastic. Hence, if there were to be a need that I’ll have to up PES in order to sign on, I guess my chances are there as well?

Would appreciate any information/feedback regarding the above issue :) I’ll be booking in on the 8 of May, and my Section Commander has stated that if I do have intentions of upping my PES status, he will send me to the MO straight on 8 May.",8f1b799a-10be-11e9-a22a-0ebe2cfd4fcc,Question,1587277740.0

2) Hows the work - life balance and hows the culture there?

3) Do we get to go for overseas attachment and if yes, how long?

4) I'm from HNITEC so they're offering me an extended 3-4 years NS and while doing Work-Study Diploma for free. Is it worth it?

Timeline will be as follow:
Y1 : BMT + Ab-initio + OJT
Y2 : Attached to unit + WSDIP
Y3 : Extension of service + WSDIP
Y4-6 : Extension of service

tips Being muslim in the army,21,isiczh,NationalServiceSG,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/isiczh/tips_being_muslim_in_the_army/,21,"i have yet to enlist, and im deferring till further notice.

I know singapore is a diverse country and we barely have any cases of racism here. So this may seem like a stupid question. But what is it like to be muslim in the army?

What are the options for me to keep a beard? I'm of the opinion that the beard for a muslim is obligatory as it is part of our nature as a man. Only females don't have beards (unless in special cases).

Will i be missing a lot of my prayers due to the training?

Any other tips for me and the other pre-enlistees before we take a big leap into NS life?


also, there were 2 commando guys who told me if i keep deferring, I'll get an L unit, or a ""shit"" unit. what does he mean?",8f1b799a-10be-11e9-a22a-0ebe2cfd4fcc,Question,1600108122.0

I feel like my anxiety's getting the better of me.  It's been progressively getting worse, and I don't know what to do now.

I can't help but think that my sergeants are coming after me.  I believe that they want to harm me, therefore I must go out of my way to harm them first, be it physically or mentally.  I can't help but think of the amount of joy and satisfaction I'll get from watching blood spill from their carotids or the amount of sorrow and / or annoyance they'll feel when they realize that someone's been cyberstalking them and misusing their contact information for all the wrong reasons.  It makes me feel safe thinking of all these things.

So far, I've been on MC, but I'm genuinely afraid that one day, they'll just think that I'm malingering and simply revoke the sick leave given to me by my outside psychiatrist.  I just received a call this afternoon telling me to go back to camp and not report sick outside.
