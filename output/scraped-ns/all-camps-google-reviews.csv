ashvin nagi, 1 star ,a month ago,"Don't bother showing up at the timing assigned to you, you'll end waiting for more than 2 hours only to realise that you're the last person in line. Doctors don't really care which is fair because they don't really have a choice but to be there. This place is a complete waste of space and time."
Samuel Toh, 1 star ,2 months ago,just here to read through the NSF reviews LOL
Bib Bob, 1 star ,3 months ago,Takes a extremely long time due to waiting. Overall a complete waste of time.
Raey, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"All staff are professional and knows what they are doing. Idk what the bad reviews is about but for my personal experience, everyone there is very helpful and take initiative to help me out."
J.O.L, 1 star ,4 months ago,Unfriendly staff. The guards are doing their job but the staff keep pushing them to do more stuff which they are not suppose to. Absolutely atrocious. There is one woman at the VAC who keeps changing her tone when she talks to people and threatens people to leave. She always removes her mask to talk to people to show her expressions.
WX Q, 1 star ,5 months ago,staff at medical screening station 5 for height and weight is extremely rude and unfriendly
Pointless Sentience, 1 star ,a year ago,Staff were not serious; impatient. Undesirably long waiting times. Would not recommend CMPB to a friend.
Hwee Peng Low, 1 star ,a year ago,Just sent my son for the pre enlistment checkup this morning.  The guard at the entrance couldn't give clear instructions.  Keep shouting when we got our son to alight since we couldn't drive further in. Hello please train your army …
Anonymous Reviewer, 1 star ,11 months ago,One of the most inconvenient locations I have ever seen. Terrible directions. Rude staff. Expect this whole process to take hours. 100% not recommended.
Edmund Schirmer, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Ok lah, this review is based on my visit January 1990, so maybe sikit out of date. NSF staff was ok, typical bo chap, happy like bird to  tio a switch off vocation. MO, on the other hand, seemed si peh buay song. This is probably because he …"
James, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Tbh, its not that bad of a place to visit, contrary to what others are saying."
SY Tang, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Those enlisting here, PLEASE make sure you declare all medical conditions. severe or minor, to the Medical officer during your checkup.
