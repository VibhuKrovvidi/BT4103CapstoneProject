3,fut5cac,NationalServiceSG,0,"Hey, despite what everyone says, it comes down to whether or not you personally prefer that sort of life. If you think that you are unable to handle too much pressure or dont think that you want to do it at all, then being a man is perfectly fine. Remember, serving 2 years as a man can still be meaningful. It is just what you make of it. Meaningfulness is what you make of it, so don't be pressured to go to cmd sch just to get sth out of NS. I suggest you ask around for others' experiences in OCS/SCS before you make a decision. The more info you have the better a decision you can make for yourself. Also, asking whether command sch is worth it is a very personal opinion so I suggest you ask more probing questions about life there suited to your concerns so you can decide for yourself whether it is worth it.",1592178677.0,h89q21
1,furguah,NationalServiceSG,0,"Personally, yes. Being a commander gives you more freedoms and allowances to do your things, but do note it does come with additional responsibilities. If you haven't yet, I suggest keeping and open mind and going through field camp first before coming to your definitive decision.

I should add that on my end, I wanted to go command school to help myself grow and put myself out of my comfort zone. Basically, I went in of my own accord, and to prove myself, not other people. I can say it definitely helped me grow as an individual faster than I would have outside and even where I fucked up there were lessons I learnt from it all.

It's a great time also to practice your leadership skills, and at the very least, that's something you can carry over to the working world (yes, army leadership isn't exactly the same as civilian leadership, but there are some things you can carry over). If you're unsure tbh then your BMT is a great time to try out leadership and to see how interested you are in it - ask for a platoon IC role for instance if you wish and see how comfortable you are with it. And know it's okay if you don't feel like command school material or are just disinterested. It's a personal choice and one shouldn't be forced to go command school - I never forced my own recruits to go there, for instance, and I respected their decision no matter what, whether they wanted to be a man or commander.

End of the day, I feel this is a decision you should make - We can only advise and show you the way, you take the step :)",1592129990.0,h89q21

But at the end of the day, if wanting to be a leader in this organization is not your thing, it’s fine to not go command school.

Being a man has its perks too and moreover it’s only two years of your life. There’s much more things to pursue during NS and it’s easier to do so when you are just a man. It’s perfectly fine to not follow the hype if you don’t want to.",1592145823.0,h89q21

23,gjfbnsz,NationalServiceSG,0,"Officer Cadet School is shiong, no doubt but batches and batches of cadets commission from it, so it is not impossible. Physical intensity wise, it is far tougher than BMT, much much tougher, but training is still progressive, they won't make you do insane stuff right off the bat.

7 hours of uninterrupted rest is only enforced at times when there is a conduct the next day, like an outfield or PT session. If not, you CAN get turned out in the middle of the night. Also when you are on outfield missions, there is no such thing as 7 hours of uninterrupted rest.

Side note if you happen to get posted to MIDS Wing (Navy), there is no lights out timing, cadets can spend the whole entire night studying - which is why MIDS wing has this famous saying of ""lighthouse"", because the lights never turn off in MIDS Wing.

The only time you get the 7 hours when outfield is during section/platoon training, or NAVEX (navigation exercises), where you manage your own time (though you have to report sitrep in the morning so you can't really just toh).

When your outfields turn into missions, there is no 7 hours. I fondly remember my Taiwan EX Starlight, in one of the many different exercises, a 5d4n outfield, the amount of continuous sleep at max is 2hrs - though I managed to get some shut eye during ""Stand-to"", prone and juz toh until someone kicks your leg. Mission appointment holders tend to only have at most 3hrs of sleep in the span of the entire 5 days.

Personally, as I have only been through Infantry OCC, the total amount of days I spent outfield (I actually counted) is 60 days. That is 2 whole months being out in the field as a trainee. This is not counting the time after you commission and become an officer, you will still have to go outfield with your unit - but it depends on what appointment and posting you get.

Shower and toilets are wayyyyyyy better than BMTC. This is because the structure of OCS is newer as it was built later than BMTC and that people take good care of the facilities there - reporting it quickly when they find damages. Area cleaning 100% is really 100% spotless kind, cadets are expected to hold the highest level of standard during standby area. You can even akin the toilets to being HOTEL level cleanliness when ready for inspection.

Regimentation wise, it is always held to the highest standards. Officer Cadets are really the LOWEST lifeforms in the SAF. You can expect the punishments to be very creative and can sometimes be very miserable, BMTC has the limit of punishments based on the IPS system, but in OCS the fuckening can last for longggggggg longgggg time. My friends from Sierra Wing describes their fuckening as the 45 minutes of hell - basically non-stop whacking in the training shed for 45 minutes. My platoon mate once got threatened by my instructor to write a 5000 words essay, each letter different colour for the platoon's fuck up - yeah, morale can get really low in OCS. You will see the good, the bad and the ugly in people in OCS. Comparing with your peers are always almost impossible and toxicity can exist in the highest levels like openly chatting shit about someone in the section/platoon/wing. However, the flip side is that you can also find brothers that care for people.

But like what my instructor once said ""you are experiencing this kind of pain and suffering right now, so those who are under you in the future won't have to suffer this kind of pain"".

My advice to you if you are looking to want to go to command school, ask yourself why do you want to be a specialist or an officer? You are expected to carry yourself throughout NS, people will look up to you for instructions and go to you all the time. You will need to juggle the expectations from the higher ups (OC, CO, etc.) as well as the wellbeing and welfare of your men (your PS, sec comms and men). Don't be an officer or a specialist for the wrong reasons - such as the higher pay or the prestige, because if you have the wrong motivations and when you discover it is all not butterflies and fluffy clouds, your NS experience will be very miserable.

P.S. Oh don't forget, after ORDing, your ORNS 10 years you will still have to do what your rank allows you to do. It is not just the 2 years.",1610802678.0,ky9ae3
8,gjfg70x,NationalServiceSG,0,Meanwhile scs is paradise compared to bmt and ocs,1610805953.0,ky9ae3
4,gjfgajf,NationalServiceSG,0,"Start:
It was a huge jump from BMT as we were like thrown into this institute and little to no instructions were pumped to us. We were instantly punished for SDM stuff and downed a lot on the first day. I can tell you that the whole damn platoon had really Low morale and we just wanted to leave. Many OOCed and it really made us quite tempted to do so too. Marching has to be on point, discipline is really like uptight, admin time sometimes is just really close to <1 hour per day. I think that in the beginning, what made me dread OCS was the discipline and how you will get punished for the smallest things because my instructors were super strict about the smallest things.
Facilities:
Everything is on point here, 7 hours is a must and the toilets here are Gucci. It’ll be a huge step up from BMT.
Service term:
The PT sessions here are essentially free, we can have back to back daily workouts and we will barely have like time to even rest up for the next conduct. It really makes you on the ball as fk as they can call you down anytime for anything. There are days where we would have tests, PTs and then lessons which made us really really tired. Some days you wake up and you ask yourself why are you still in this shitty place. Outfield is every 2 weeks and force prep is super super stringent here. We were mostly called down by some alarm and we have to pack everything according to the standardisation. In OCS, If one person fks up, the whole platoon gets it. The only thing that keeps you going is the people around you. In OCS, people are motivated af and you will get reeled into the good vibes and CHIONG also. You’ll eventually start laughing even when you get fked pretty badly. 
Excercises:
In OCS, we have excercises every 2 weeks
EX skylark/nightbird - navigation
EX cocoon - section fighting training 
EX centipede - section fighting assessment
EX dump in - platoon attack/defence mission
EX coyote  - urban ops training
EX relentless - navigation/jungle survival/fighting

(These are the major exercises)
The outfield here is objectively driven. For my wing, ALPHA WING (P2 121/20), it’s tradition to have Charlie mikes (continue mission) after some missions to train us mentally. For example, after centipede, we went up the bus just to wake up at Lim Chu Kang where we had to tactically March like 5km back and 1km before we reached the finishing line, we got sniper ambushed and had to transport casualties back, we then received  out wing formation patch where we are inoculated into alpha wing. Excercises are tough and many will suffer injuries, most commonly the knees, and many will Toh, but you just have to be mentally fit enough to keep pressing on.
Rounding it off:
Ngl OCS is tough, although not mentally and physically for me, the disciplinary part to me is really really stupid and I hate it. But after a few weeks, you will learn to just suck thumb and carry on, it really gets easier after that. The most important thing in OCS is your platoon mates, they will be the one to push you on. When you survive without 2 nights of sleep in EX dump in due to continuous digging or when you have to do 6 fire fights per day for 3 days straight, it really eats into your psyche and the only thing that pushes you on is the people around you. You will start loving and appreciating those back home and appreciating outside food. OCS tempers your mental resilience through shitty times. But push on really, it’s tough but it’ll be worth it. I didn’t stay for pro term as I got posted out, but the brotherhood in Alpha is something that I’ll never forget.",1610806027.0,ky9ae3

so the story goes that I was sent to Air wing.

Training was still shiong but compared to the other wings it was very relaxed.

 I remember using the computer in my bunk and eating my uncle toby fruit bar (not supposed to eat in bunk but no one cared in air wing) and we watched Golf Wing march the whole night. Damn poor thing. 

We actually got irritated that the noise downstairs disturbed our sleep. hahahaha

Navy wing was next to us and every morning they ring the fucking bell while we still lying in bed.

Facilities wise,OCS is good.they will drill into you that you are there to be grilled and trained as a commander
The training will really built up your real physical fitness and combat fitness.Tri service and Service term still ok.Once you hit Pro term,that is when your mental need to be strong.Just enjoy the journey if you do make.it to OCS.

Right now as trainee is so much slack compared to bmt even the pt conducts here are nothing, we do metabolic circuit without the jumping jacks between exercises. But different places may differ, I have sections mates saying some are quite shag having SOC etc. But I think if you get any combat fit vocation, you'll have to go through more training for the vocation, eg the medic course is 12 weeks long, other courses may differ so its basically bmt again but less strenuous and more studying here.

Training wise scs is shorter than ocs, personally I can’t imagine going through 9 months of intense training but ~4-5 months sergeant course for me was ok. 

In scs there are more opportunities for you to lead and train your leadership skills. As trainers are also prev batch scs cadets they know what you go through, and are mostly very friendly. 

In my term everyone gets to be a sect comm for a few weeks, some get chosen to be “oc” or “sm” to come up with the routine order, and plan for the day. In my opinion this really helps hone your leadership skills. 

Training wise found term you do normal infantry stuff, stuff like basic navi, cqb, sect movement etc then pro term you will specialise in your vocation training. 

However I went through scs during covid period so training was extremely dialed down, so maybe it was paradise only for that period lol

Ways include, getting cancer or any terminal illness, doing things which only insane people would do (such as repeatedly fapping in front of your superiors and commanders even after going DB), gain some mental issues (or fake having them and convince the specialists at IMH that you have them), get crippled, etc

Muslims in the army tend to be close-knit, depending on your company. My company in BMT required Muslims to go to a different cookhouse for Muslim food and needless to say, the entire Muslim recruits will march there, along the way you tend to make friends from other platoons which otherwise you wouldn't meet if you weren't Muslim. 

You will miss prayers if you are not careful with your time. There will certainly be enough admin time to do prayers, but asar time is the easiest to miss due to PT/Training. Had a really religious dude who prayed even in outfield.

Decreased chances of facial issues such as acne, etc. The beard retains moisture in the face.

psychological aspect, people tend to trust men who have beards than those who don't.

However, seeing that there's no use complaining to your superiors now that someone (presumably one of your superiors) has told you that ""\[you cannot\] report sick outside"", my advice for you is to just not give a damn as to what your superiors say and seek the help you need (yes, I'm telling you to skip the chain of command).  Your own mental wellbeing is more important than what someone else says about you ""malingering""; if they want to keep up with the latter and berate you for seeking the help you need, get your parents involved or even your doctor(s).  Have your parents call your company's hotline and complain about their refusal to let you take care of yourself, or if you're visiting the medical officers, provide them with the contact information of your psychiatrist if they have a problem.

I know this isn't much, but **please, please** don't do anything stupid in the meantime.

**IF POSSIBLE, CALL UP/MEET UP WITH YOUR OUTSIDE PSYCHIATRIST AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ASAP.**

Secondly, your PSes usually don't care about that shit; they can't do anything about you since you have medical leave, which is almost irrefutable unless they launch a full investigation. Which in your case, since it's genuine, they will find you innocent.

Don't push your luck thinking, ""Oh, I can tahan; no problem.""

2. The cookhouse is operated by SATS. In my opinion the food’s pretty okay especially during lunch time. Not so good during dinner tho.. But i guess you can always eat at the canteen. The malay store and the chicken cutlet at ABGTC cookhouse canteen is pretty good. And its very near the guardroom too.

Can’t answer the rest, but please do not bully when hoto duty from the guard duty personnels ;) enjoy your your stay in gedong cos its the most miserable place on earth
