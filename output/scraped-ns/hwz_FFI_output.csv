5,FFI : need to go every year after 35?,Kiwi8,"Wah... really must go every year liao.  Quote: MINDEF Services > Non-ICT IPPT/RT > FAQ > Medical Excuse and Examination  Q4 I have reached 35 years old and was informed that I need to do an ""IPPT-FFI"". What is an ""IPPT-FFI""? ""IPPT-FFI"" was the term used to refer to the compulsory medical examination done for all IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 and above. The ""IPPT-FFI"" has been incorporated into the revised SAF Health Screening Programme which came into effect on 30 May 2011. There is no need to do a separate ""IPPT-FFI"" if you have already completed the SAF Health Screening Programme for that year.  All IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 years and above are required to complete the SAF Health Screening Programme every year before attempting IPPT. The aim of this medical screening is to detect any medical conditions which may make you unsuitable for the IPPT. You will not be allowed to take the IPPT if you are 35 years old and above and have not completed your SAF Health Screening Programme requirements for the year.  The SAF Health Screening Programme review will be initiated by your NS unit administrator when your IPPT window (birthday window) is open. You will be issued with a certificate after completion of your SAF health Screening Programme requirements. The certificate is valid until 30 day after your birthday. For example, if you are 35 years old, the certificate will be valid until (and including) the 30th day after your 36th birthday.",Raider04 wrote: System has changed. No longer have Phase 1 and 2.

10,FFI : need to go every year after 35?,vasilli07,"Most active units will call people back once a year so they will complete in 10 years.

20,FFI : need to go every year after 35?,derrickgoh,"Very generally speaking, yes they wouldnt touch u unless got war.  Having said that, touchwood one day if s'pore got earthquake or tsunami & extra manpower required for rescue efforts, u can still be activated.  Depending on your vocation also. Like when jamban mat escaped, some active units were deployed in the manhunt & i heard got reservist units placed on standby at last minute also. If u r combat vocation chances are higher.  Having said all that, they also dont want to call u back unless no choice. Its an admin nightmare for them. If your unit stand down liao, where do they throw u?
