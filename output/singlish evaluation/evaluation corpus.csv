As for reviews about MOs, go figure it out yourself"
1,whete you get rewarded for exercising
2,dun understand sian
3,why not book 20 IPPT instead then?
4,Should be subject to RT if you did not meet the requirements even if you’re turning 40 as it’s still ur IPPT Window tho.
5,"u will only know on the day itself, unless there are your unit commanders here in this forum. However, they are not allowed to reveal such information. Do understand what is OSA about otherwise you might get charged for it on such related offences. Recently there is a paramedic got charged under this act for your info. Nevertheless, what company you get in, how does it matter? Furthermore, this thread is IPPT-related. Make sure u know your topic and channels for feedback otherwise u will never get your answers promptly. This also applies during your upcoming stint as an NSF in the SAF."
6,MR already... Can throw away everything??
7,"Questions to ask regarding attire, as the guideline is not really comprehensive  1) If I wear short compression tights (above knee), must I wear another running pants to cover my groin, due to female instructors present. Or just wear a long singlet which is enough to cover your groin by tugging out?  2) Is wearing calf sleeves allow during test?  Intending to take IPPT at Bedok Camp. And I intend to only bring minimum items (11B, phone, water bottle), as after the test, need to ""Charlie-Mike"" 10km home-run"
8,"funky_banana wrote: hi guys, any idea if they are still giving colour tags for ipt in bedok fcc?  yellow, blue, red, green, orange still applies? Yellow = Strength and conditioning (Upper body and core mostly, for pushups and sit-ups) Blue = ""Fitness Challenge"" (Circuit training with kettle bells, weighted... bars? and stuff) (IMO, a more intensive version of yellow) Red = Cardio (aerobic fitness, for running; trainers usually will include a bit of other exercises to improve push-ups and sit-ups, just to mix things up) Green = Weight Management Programme for obese personnel. Orange = Sports.  There's a purple tag as well, so I hear, that does evening classes on weekdays like K-Pop aerobics (?) and stuff. I've never done those so if anyone could elaborate on these for a fuller picture, it would be appreciated."
9,Same for me too
10,"if you are just counting the recorded attendance, try the NS booklet on the portal"
11,"Just rmb u only can take RT-IPPT on 8th,14th,20th. So you need clear 7 RT first loh. And you only have 2 RT-IPPT (8th & 14th), the rest all RT"
12,"If your window closes on or before Feb 7, 2021, and you can’t clear it, you don’t have to clear lor. But since you have already cleared, them this wouldn’t affect you."
13,"same thing. if u failed to understand the meaning of ""in-pro"" and ""out-pro""."
14,should be correct.
15,"They will just discharge you, no attendance"
16,Ok thank you bro
17,Tomorrow resume IPT/RT liao.  Hope everyone can clear as much as possible.
18,"best to check with your unit, or division."
19,"That doesn't make any sense. I'm sure it only applies for defaulters. If not, how many ppl they need to charge for failing?"
20,"your unit is suppose to arrange for HSP FFI, not you because they need to issue u SAF100"
21,they can save ippt monetary rewards too
22,"Can check with you guys, am I able to extend my rt window by a month?"
23,"Kena called for IPPT next month, shag.."

Just want to know if I didn't clear my IPT in this window,  1) My next window will be 20 - N (let say I managed to attend 3 sessions before window closes), 20 - 3 = 17.  2) I book 17 RT, 1 per week. When will the IPPT be held?  3) Do I clear the window after attending 17 RT?  4) Once I booked RT, do I still have the flexibility like IPT that I absent myself from the session booked due to work?

50,"long time ago it was 3 big rounds around part of the camp then it changed to running around the indoor carpark ""track"" hard ground....(no rubber track to cushion) dont think it has changed. so yea, you'll probably be breathing in dust and stale air for 6 rounds."

60,"They should put ""exempted"" instead of ""not yet taken"" to avoid confusion"
61,"As long u attempted 1 IPPT/ICT-IPPT in the whole work cycle, u will not be charged."
62,MR already means no need ippt right? Then if also above 35 years old still need to FFI?
63,"Sry i got a noob qns, can't seem to find the ans online: if i failed my ippt and have been training intensely on my own but my window is over, can i directly book and pass the ippt next window instead of going through all the RTs? Do i have really have to go through all the RTs?  P.S i am also affected by the ippt shutdown and my window will end before i am ready to book and attempt"

70,"Just need to book one ippt because for IPT, only the first and last session can be IPPT. But if you really want to go for more IPPT, the first 3 IPPT sessions will be payable for attendance. You can keep attending IPPTs until you get your desired Gold/Silver/Pass w incentive."

94,What happens if I book IPPT but never attend or manage to cancel my booking?
95,If u fail ippt but u finish another 9 FIT sessions considered window cleared. If u fail ippt but never finish FIT or pass IPPT in another attempt u get charged lo simple.
96,"Hi guys, I'll be going for my first RT session this week at 7pm at Maju. I'll be rushing from work so ETA is exactly 7pm. I'm afraid I'll be slightly late if there's a jam. Any idea what the cutoff time is for inpro?"

100,Depends on your unit
101,"Hi, is there such a system change? I forgot to take my IPPT in September and now kena letter.. Thought can just continue with RT until next year September."
102,Can't you just go see a MO to inform that you are still seeking specialist consultation and is waiting hence you can't do RT?
103,"eh . . you got serve reservist one or not? u ish xdd or some ft? simi unfair for other reservist who complete usually those didnt complete 10 cycles are actually the most suffering one because unit no call back, ippt till 40 year is a nightmare man. everyone just wanna clear the 10 cycles, those holan bo tio call up is really feel sad for them"
104,"Thanks for your information. I think for our case, what we can do now is to book and attend an IPPT session and a few IPT sessions while at the same time seek help from our unit's OC/S8. I also agree that with a few IPPT/IPTs attended it would be much easier to negotiate."
105,"I was based on the earlier post by Greent: Greent wrote: Just came back for Bedok FCC and i ask some question after the instructor explain why SAT/SUN no IPPT etc. Hopefully the following answers can help some of you here and still good to ask them if any doubt cause i may heard wrongly. Q: Why SAT/SUN no IPT-IPPT ? A: The reason is HQ realize that the session start at 9.30am so by then finish about 10am+ and weather is going to be warm for 2.4km test. Q: Is this apply to all FCC on no IPT-IPPT A: Yes. ALL FCC will not conduct IPT-IPPT on SAT/SUN Q: Today mean we attend 1 training session right ? A: Yes. Today consider you attend 1 IPT session Q: So how are we going to clear the windows ? A: Our OC is going to HQ this tuesday to find out what is the solution for this impact that those unable to book all session so please check your NS portal on tuesday to find out more. Q: That's mean i still need to attend 10 IPT session la ? A: Right now the current planning is you need to HAVE AT LEAST 9 session of IPT (training) and 1 IPPT to clear your current windows. Q: Those unable to book a single IPPT session but can book 10 IPT how ? A: It's still consider you clear your windows. Q: Those cannot book 10 IPT how ? A: You need to book AT LEAST A IPPT session to void as defaulter. Unknown part *He didn't answer my question what if you book 5 IPT +1 IPPT but fail the IPPT and windows close* This one next week i ask. *He also mention RT resume on april ? Anyone can confirm ? Hope it helps you all. As from now, book at least 1 IPPT to avoid defaulter. Good luck Also not forgetting that currently none of the IPT slots have IPT-IPPT conducted. For us whose windows closed on Feb/March we might ended up not being able to take IPT-IPPT."
106,"Why clear 10 in different locations?  The normal person will just clock 9 sessions in safra gym nearest their house.  Then ippt just go through the motion . No pressure to pass   Posted from PCWX using A simple life, not a simple thing ðŸ™ðŸ»"
107,oic that is much better than last time liao
108,"Can I check how many RT sessions I need to do?  I always thought total is 20 sessions but when I checked, the system in NS portal says I need to complete 18 sessions and that I have done 16 out of 18 sessions. At first, I thought it was because of the 2 Rt-IPPT sessions I taken and were not counted among the 16 sessions, but I counted the 'Current Window Attendance' record and the 2 RT-IPPT sessions were indeed among the 16 sessions already taken."
109,Nope. 2.4km is a must-do.

115,"Hey guys, i have recently attended my first IPT-IPPT session and intended to go for the IPT in the park programme. I tried to ask the cisco instructors about the program but they said they dont know and that it is handled by other company. The NS portal also seem to be under maintenance.  Just want to check if anyone has experience attending such programme? For example, where to meet at marina bay? do they also issue colored bands for training? and how they generate the slip for attendance? Many thanks!"
116,Ran two rounds for mine then dropped out. See what your FI say loh. He tell us Min run two rounds lol
117,keep the uniform. there is always a chance they call u up again. as long u are <40. Return uniform is only for PES F or those reached 40.
118,How i know..thats what the Safety and conducting officers informed when the session starts..Only Khatib Camp no Ippt only training
119,"Anyone knows if for example I'm enlisting on 12 Aug 2020 but managed to pass ippt before enlisting according to their protocol and stuff so no issue.  I was told I will get another enlistment date soon. So, 12 Aug + 8 weeks later is enlistment date?  Anyone knows or has experienced same thing?"
120,why so? there are others who skip 1 year also.
121,Next year RT will be bad. Many who can't clear IPT have to go RT and the slots will be limited too. I can see many defaulters.
122,Now you have 2 years to complete your RT.
123,"Can I get incentives for year 0 ippt? If not, I won't bother going for it"
124,"4,8,17"

127,"Looks like it has been raining on and off since the start of the new year till now, hence any attempts for ippt shall be postponed till further notice.  When do you guys think will be a good time to attempt ippt?"
128,Wait for around 5 days after your birthday to receive your waiver sms.
129,Maybe you can call the NS hotline again and request for your S8 or DYS8's contact details like email or contact number so that you can contact him directly.  Many years ago when I unknowingly defaulted my IPPT (due to me being in holding list for a long time prior to that) and kenna charged I also called the NS hotline and they conveyed my message to my unit's DYS8 and a few days later my DYS8 contacted me and told me that they will gave me a chance and I did not get charged in the end.
130,Will get one.  The army men probably deployed to do things covid related.
131,It only count as 1 ORNS activity in the same work year 
132,"Hi I am new to this forum.  I had completed only 9/10 ipt as shown in my ns portal but the status is shown as below:  ""You have Completed your IPT for your current window. You may continue to book sessions if you wish to improve your results.  Your next IPPT window will open on 1 Jul 2021.""  I did attempt a non-ict ippt (in the same window) before starting the ipt program, in this case, do i still have to attempt a non-ict ippt to clear my ippt for my current window?  I am scared cos they said ""Completed your IPT for your current window"" and not completed IPPT for current window, when the instructions says that ""The 10th IPT session (last) will remain as an IPPT attempt. Do book an IPPT session (not IPT) for this last session.""  Right now I am still thinking if i should attempt the non-ict ippt session that i booked for tomorrow night.  It's my first ippt window, so I am new to this and unsure if the message: ""You have Completed your IPT for your current window."" means that I am done for ippt requirement for current window.  I had already seek help from NS portal live chat service, but their operator replied that they will escalate to my unit and advise further, get back in 3-5 working days.  Any helpful replies will be good, thanks in advance."

138,"Don't stress yourself la. No point as 2020 really a roller coaster for everyone esp those jobless LL need to do this IPPT and scarified their income .... As your previous question, you should contact your S8/OC now than later as give them time to do review the case etc ...."

140,The carpark where they park the big vehicles haha

146,"As long as it is not cancelled, the government deems it as safe? So you gotta make your own call."
147,"IPT-IPPT reporting timing is the timing that I booked? (e.g. 1800hrs). So in that sense, they are many different ippt time slots in one evening because there are quite a few ipt-ippt slots to choose from, right?"
148,"hi all. last year i took my ippt at khatib fcc.  the 2.4 quite jialat because of the sun and big wind. it is run around stadium track 6 rounds that kind. my running alr not v good but heng i passed.  this year i want try kranji fcc. the ippt route is it easier?? like maybe under shelter, etc??? quite concerned for running. for static stations i think every camp also use machine alr so pretty much the same"
149,"If you take a look in that MINDEF fb posts, many people have feedback that they are unable to book any IPT-IPPT sessions and not much slots are available except those on Mondays.  At least I am still able to book a IPT-IPPT session and I also plan to take IPT-IPPT and trigger IPT."
150,I am quite confused... Think they need to make clear whether we will be charged if we fail our IPPT. Don't think MINDEF/SAF is that stupid to make us abuse the system anyway.
