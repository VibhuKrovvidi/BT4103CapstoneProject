Before the revamp, the 50-year-old Tiong Bahru market was as famous for its chwee kueh and pau as it was for its grimy, one-storey ramshackle premises. .. Except for one lor mee stall, all of the stalls have returned to the permanent site. They include the famous chwee kueh, pig organ soup, pau, Teochew kueh, lor mee and ming jiang kueh stalls.  2006 Teo Pau Lin The Sunday Times (LifeStyle) (from Straits Times Interactive), 25 June. They look dead-easy to make. So why are there so few good stalls selling chwee kueh? The traditional Teochew breakfast staple is nothing more than steamed rice cakes topped with chai poh (preserved radish). But stallowners will tell you that a lot of hard work goes into making it. Rice flour has to be mixed with the right amount of water, then poured into small cups and steamed over a carefully controlled fire. The resulting texture should be smooth, springy and not too mushy. The radish topping is seasoned with sugar and other condiments, then fried in lard, although most stalls these days have switched to vegetable oil. For all the backbreaking work, the money is not great. Most stalls sell four cakes for only $1. K.F. Seetoh, street food guru and chief executive of consultancy Makansutra, says that chwee kueh is one of the most ingenious peasant foods cooked up by the Teochews in China. ‘It’s the ultimate poor man’s food. The peasants had only rice and vegetables, but they’ve managed to turn it into cakes with a preserved, re-fried topping. It was born out of desperation,’ he says. The most famous stall here is the 48-year-old Jian Bo Shui Kueh in Tiong Bahru Food Centre, whose trademark is the super fragrant topping with sesame seeds. This recipe has been copied by many stalls, although others have stuck to the plain chai poh version.",,,

It is a public holiday in Singapore. As it is believed that souls of departed relatives roam the earth during this time, rows of lamps called dīyās [Hind. डीया dīyā, a light; a lamp, lantern, candle; the vessel holding the oil for a light (McGregor)] or pradīps [Hind. < Skt. पडीप pradīpa a light, lamp, lantern < Skt. पडीप् pradīp to flame forth, blaze, burst into flames (Monier-Williams)]) consisting of ghee in small earthen pots with cotton wicks are lit to guide them on their return journey.

¶ The festival is also known as Divali or Diwali. Several mythological legends are associated with the origin of Deepavali. According to one, Deepavali commemorates the killing of an evil demon, Narakasura, by Lord Krishna, and thus the triumph of good over evil. The second relates that the festival was first held to celebrate the return of the Rama, King of Ayodhya, his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana to Koshala after a war in which he had killed the demon Ravana. As it was getting dark, people along the way lit oil lamps to light their way.
     Monier-Williams states that the festival is held in honour of Kārttikeya. This is a name of Skanda, the Hindu god of war, because he was reared by the six Kṛittikās or Pleiades. According to one legend he was the son of Śiva without the intervention of his wife, his generative energy being cast into the fire and then received by the Ganges, whence Kārttikeya is sometimes described as a son of Agni and Gangā. When born he was fostered by the Pleiades, and became six-headed when they offered him their six breasts. In other accounts he is a son of Śiva and Pārvatī or Durgā. Skanda may also have been called Kārttikeya because the month Kārttika is the best for warfare: he is sometimes described as presiding over thieves.

The process is common in India, but certainly quite strange to Europe. The men, generally strong, stalwart Klings or Bengalese, naked to a strip of cloth round the loins, stand up to their knees in the bed of the stream with a flat slab of stone in front of them. They seize the pieces of clothing one by one – if it is a shirt by the tail, if a pair of pants by the legs – dip them into the stream, swing them over their heads, and bring them down with their whole force on the stone slab. This operation is continued with each piece till it is thoroughly cleaned. A great deal of damage is, of course, done to the clothes by this process; it is especially fatal to buttons; but on the other hand, it undoubtedly secures a matchless whiteness.  2003 Victor R. Savage & Brenda S.A. Yeoh, Toponymics 110 Dhoby Ghaut is derived from the Indian words dhoby, meaning “laundry” and ghaut, meaning “the steps along the bank of a river”. The name stems from the laundry activities that used to take place here from the 1830s onwards. Indian dhobis (Bengali and Madrasi) used to wash their clothes using the water from Stamford Canal (formerly Sungei Bras Basah or Freshwater Stream). The clothes were dried on empty land subsequently occupied by the Ladies Lawn Tennis Club, now occupied by the triangular-shaped park opposite Cathay cinema. About five acres large, this used to be called Dhoby Green. In the past, the whole area was associated with laundry activities. Hence Queen Street in Tamil was vannan teruvu or “street of the dhobis” and the Malays call it “kampong dhobi”.  2004 Surekha Yadav Today, 20 January, 30 Born into a family of dhobis (Indian washermen), Mr Suppiah was intent on working towards a brighter future. ..

Also known as the Dumpling Festival.
¶ The festival is known in Mand. as 端午节 Duānwǔjié: duān end, extremity; beginning; upright, proper + wǔ noon, midday; the seventh of the 12 Earthly Branches + jié festival, red-letter day, holiday (Chi.–Eng. Dict.).
2005 The Sunday Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 12 June. Dumpling festival means little to young Chinese [title] Millions of Chinese celebrated the Dragon Boat Festival yesterday, but while boat races and the sticky rice dumplings known as zongzi may be growing in popularity, it seems the roots of the festival are being forgotten. This is in spite of the event being one of the three major traditional Chinese festivals, along with Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival. For more than 2,000 years, the festival, which falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, has been marked by the eating of zongzi and dragon boat races. The most widely accepted version of the festival’s origin is that it is in remembrance of patriotic poet Qu Yuan. The loyal counsellor drowned himself in 221 b.c. [sic] in the Miluo River in central Hunan province after the Chu king, who fell under the influence of corrupt ministers, banished him. The locals dropped bamboo cylinders stuffed with rice into the river to prevent fishes from feeding on his body.  2006 Clarissa Oon The Straits Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 10 June. China has shortlisted the Dragon Boat Festival, acupuncture and Shaolin gongfu as among several hundred cultural traditions worth preserving, as the country marks its first Cultural Heritage Day today. ..  Officials and experts have suggested raising the status of traditional Chinese festivals like the Dragon Boat and Mid-Autumn, putting them on a par with the Spring Festival and Chinese New Year. .. Many in China were stung by South Korea’s successful application to Unesco at the end of last year to have its own version of the Dragon Boat Festival recognised as a world cultural heritage. China’s Dragon Boat Festival, which originated nearly 2,500 years ago, began as a commemoration of the sacrificial act of the patriotic poet Qu Yuan (340–278 BC) who drowned himself when the capital of his state fell to invaders. Legend has it that Qu’s countrymen threw zongzi, or pyramid-shaped glutinous rice dumplings, into the water to distract fish from eating his body. One Shanghai school principal, Mr Lu Jichun, told Chinese media recently: ‘Why is it that South Korea has done such a good job preserving this festival while, for us, much of the traditional culture surrounding our own festivals has been lost? ‘When children today think of the Dragon Boat Festival, all they can think of is eating zongzi. For the Mid-Autumn Festival, they can only think of eating mooncakes.’ One reason why young people do not feel much for such festivals is that celebrating them had long been officially discouraged, particularly during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.",,,

The mangosteen is most plentiful in December, January, and February; the durian, of which there are two crops a year from the same tree, in June and July, and in December and January; and the docoo in November, December, and January.  302 But it is in the luxuriance of the dessert perhaps more than anything else that the tables of Singapore are to be distinguished, and it is little wonder that it should be so; for there is no season of the year at which an abundance of fruit cannot be obtained. .. There are plantains, ducoos, mangoes, rambutans, pomeloes, and mangosteens; the latter fruit is peculiar to the Straits of Malacca and to Java, and so great is its fame that to India or China no present or gift from Singapore is more acceptable than a basket of them.  397 Appendix I.

¶ It is said that ee fu noodles were created in China during the reign of the Qiánlóng Emperor [Mand. 乾隆: qián (arch.) male + lóng grand; prosperous, thriving; intense, deep] (18 October 1735 – 9 February 1796) of the Qing Dynasty [Mand. 清朝 Qīng Cháo: qīng unmixed, clear + cháo dynasty] (1644–1911) and named after the poet, calligrapher, minor painter and seal carver 伊秉绶 Yī Bǐngshòu (1754–1815) from 太宁 Tàiníng in 惠州 Huìzhōu, 广东 Guǎngdōng (Canton) Province, China. The story is told that Yi often had gatherings of the literati and other guests at his home to recite and compose poems. As his cook was very busy during these events, Yi suggested that he should make noodles out of flour, eggs and water, coil them into cakes, air-dry the noodles, and fry them before storing them. Thus, when Yi’s guests came, it would only be necessary to put the cakes of noodles into boiling water and add other ingredients to them. On one occasion, he served these noodles to fellow poet and calligrapher 宋湘 Sòng Xiāng, who found them delicious and asked him what they were called. Yi replied that these noodles had been created in his own household and had no name. Song then proposed that they be called ‘ee fu noodles’. See the Makan Time website (2004, accessed 11 April 2006) and the article “最滋味:伊面”,《广州日报》(“Most Flavoursome: Ee Noodles”, Guangzhou Daily Newspaper) (8 October 2005, accessed 7 September 2006).
     It is possible that ee fu noodles are served at wedding banquets because the long noodles signify the length of the marriage and their stickiness the closeness of the husband and wife.

¶ The vegetable is often eaten during the Chinese New Year season because its name sounds like the Mand. 发财 fācái which means “get rich, make a fortune, make a pile, coin money, earn good money” (Comp. Chi.–Eng. Dict.). It is known in Cant. as Fat Choy.

465,"fire-walking n. & a. [Eng.]  A n. An act of walking across a fire pit containing burning coals, performed by Hindu men at a ceremony which is held on the seventh day of Aipasi [Tam. ஜப்பசி Aippaci < Skt. आशवयुज् āśvayuj harnessing horses; having horses put to (as a carriage); name of a constellation, the head of Aries; the first lunar mansion; the month Āśvina; born under the constellation Aśvayuj < Skt. आशव āśva relating or belonging to a horse, equestrian, coming from a horse; drawn by horses; Skt. अशव aśva a horse, esp. a stallion (Monier-Williams)], the seventh month of the Tamil calendar (mid-October to mid-November of the Gregorian calendar), eight days before Deepavali. The ceremony is performed as a penance or thanksgiving in honour of the goddesses Sri Mariamman and Sri Drowpathai Amman. In Singapore devotees walk from the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road to the Sri Mariamman Temple, the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore (founded between mid-1819 and 1821), in South Bridge Road where the ceremony has been held since 1840.  B a. Of or relating to fire-walking or the fire-walking ceremony.
¶ Fire-walking is known in Tam. as தீமிதீ tīmiti [Tam. தீ tī fire; lamp; sacrificial fire; to be burnt + மித miti to tread on; to tread down, trample; step into a tank or well (Tam. Lex.)].
     The Mahabharata relates that the childless Drupada, king of Panchala, prayed for a son to enable him to seek vengeance against his enemy, Dronacharya. Due to his faith, a son, Dhrishtadyumna, and a daughter, Drowpathai or Draupadi, were born to him out of a holy fire on his oblation altar. Draupadi was put through severe tests in her life but was aided by Lord Krishna, with whom she shared a special platonic relationship. On one occasion, one of Draupadi’s five husbands, Yudhishthira, lost her in a game of dice that he played with his cousin Duryodhana after having pledged her as a chattel. Duryodhana ordered Draupadi to be dragged by her hair to the royal court and to be disrobed before the people there assembled. Draupadi cried out to Lord Krishna, who protected her honour by giving her a sari that could never be fully unravelled. To add insult to injury, Yudhishthira accused Draupadi of infidelity with Lord Krishna. To prove her innocence, Draupadi walked across a pit of burning coals and, with Lord Krishna’s help, emerged unscathed.
     It appears that the fire-walking ceremony is related to the worship of Draupadi because of her birth out of holy fire, the test of her virtue by walking on burning coals, or her miraculous purification by fire after she spent a year in turn with each of her five husbands. Devotees participate in the fire-walking ceremony in honour of Draupadi and as a test of their purity and their faith to her; it is said that if a devotee is not pure, he will fail the test and sustain burns.
A 1931 L. Elizabeth Lewis National Geographic Magazine, April, vol. LIX, 513–516. The fire-walking Hindus of Singapore [title]. .. After an absence of two years, I had been back in Singapore only a few hours when my English school-teacher hostesses rushed into their apartment with the breathless news that a Hindu acquaintance had given them reserved-seat tickets for a Treemiri (fire-walking). .. The devotees, including quite a number of women, approximated 400. Some were kneeling and touching the earth with their foreheads, while others, more devout, were literally groveling in the dirt. A few were endeavoring to crawl or roll completely around the temple.. Many of those who had made a vow to undergo torture had prepared their bodies the preceding month by some form of penance and had refrained from eating for a day before the event. While these zealots were proceeding with their tasks, a bed of coals was being prepared. Great piles of wood were burned to embers; then the ashes were raked into a neat bed about 24 feet long. It seemed hours to us before it reached this stage, as the atmosphere was rendered almost unbearable by the intense heat. At the end of the mass of live coals was dug a pool, which was filled with milk brought to the spot in earthernware jars. The images of the gods were then brought from the temple and placed near this pool of milk. .. [T]he priests who held back the devotees began to lash them with whips, and one by one they made a dash, barefooted, across the red-hot coals into the pool of milk. Each participant wore a short covering of cheesecloth stained yellow by saffron water, and each carried in his hands, clenched above his head, a twig of green from a tree supposed to possess curative properties.. The wrists were also tied together with yellow amulets. If the person was pure, the amulet would remain unbroken. I did not see any break. .. Walking through fire has become a custom for the curing of bodily ills or the overcoming of other calamities.  2005 The Straits Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 22 October. More than 3,000 Hindu men will gather at the Sri Mariamman Temple in South Bridge Road on Monday to participate in this year’s fire-walking ceremony. At 1.30am, they will walk 4km from the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road to the Sri Mariamman Temple. There, they will tread across a 4m fire pit as a form of penance or thanksgiving in honour of goddesses Sri Mariamman and Sri Drowpathai Amman. Only men perform this ritual. Women will walk around the fire pit after all the men have crossed. Before that, they will assemble in Mosque Street to watch the proceedings on large TV screens. Members of the public can view the ceremony from 4am onwards. On that same night, a brightly lit silver chariot will glide down Serangoon Road symbolising the triumphant procession of the goddess Sri Drowpathai Amman after the successful fire-walking.

Five foot ways were so ubiquitous in my childhood days that they were almost an integral part of life.

Like cheese, fu yu comes in different grades: from the common salty China-made kind sold at any supermarket to the finer, creamier cubes from Hong Kong. Hong Kong fu yu is hard to come by in Singapore, so beancurd snobs like me have to go to Lau Chiu Tai Food Supplies, a rare shop here that stocks the old Hong Kong brand Liu Ma Kee.

2006 The Sunday Times (from Straits Times Interactive) 15 October. Alkaline water, also known as gan sui in Cantonese and air abu in Malay, is a clear solution of the salts sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and sometimes sodium phosphate. Because it is often called lye water, it is frequently confused with lye or caustic soda, which is sodium hydroxide, a much harsher chemical which has limited culinary applications in the West. In the Asian kitchen, alkaline water has few and specific uses. The characteristic springiness of Hong Kong-style mee is due to gan sui, which is added to noodle dough to firm up its texture, and give it a yellow tint. It does the same for glutinous rice in kee chang (yellow alkaline glutinous rice dumplings) and in their Malay cousin, kuih lopes. .. Dried cuttlefish or squid are sometimes briefly soaked in gan sui for the opposite effect – it makes them more tender when rehydrated.  2015 Chris Tan The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 7 June, 23 Alkaline water: A solution of sodium carbonate and/or potassium carbonate.

In the effort to preserve Chinese culture, what is the position on street opera or wayang? I understand that this art form belongs to popular culture rather than to mainstream Chinese literary tradition. During the Seventh Month, street operas are put on by sponsors for the benefit of the hungry ghosts rather than for human audiences. It is common to see an opera troupe valiantly performing before an audience of one or two elderly people. Recently, in my HDB estate, I was pleased to see a troupe performing before a fair-size audience, including a scattering of fascinated kids. However, the getai auction was going on close by and the actors could be heard only in the intervals between the auctioneering. It seemed as though the organisers had no idea at all of opera as an art form. I hope street opera can be preserved and respected as an art form, and its practitioners respected as artists.  2006 Richard Seah Siew Sai The Straits Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 16 June.

The HDB ‘heartland’ where already 90% of HDB dwellers own their flats is the right target group for the Government to concentrate on.]  1999 Goh Chok Tong Prime Minister’s National Day Rally Speech 1999, 22 August, paras. 163–167 We also need to maintain cohesion between cosmopolitans and heartlanders. As Singapore becomes more international, two broad categories of people will emerge. One group I call the “cosmopolitans”, because their outlook is international. They speak English but are bilingual. They have skills that command good incomes – banking, IT, engineering, science and technology. They produce goods and services for the global market. Many cosmopolitans use Singapore as a base to operate in the region. They can work and be comfortable anywhere in the world. The other group, the heartlanders, make their living within the country. Their orientation and interests are local rather than international. Their skills are not marketable beyond Singapore. They speak Singlish. They include taxi-drivers, stallholders, provision shop owners, production workers and contractors. Phua Chu Kang is a typical heartlander. Another one is Tan Ah Teck. If they emigrate to America, they will probably settle in a Chinatown, open a Chinese restaurant and call it an “eating house”. Both heartlanders and cosmopolitans are important to Singapore’s well being. Heartlanders play a major role in maintaining our core values and our social stability. They are the core of our society. Without them, there will be no safe and stable Singapore, no Singapore system, no Singapore brand name. Cosmopolitans, on the other hand, are indispensable in generating wealth for Singapore. They extend our economic reach. The world is their market. Without them, Singapore cannot run as an efficient, high performance society. The challenge for us is to get the heartlanders to understand what the cosmopolitans contribute to Singapore’s and their own well being, and to get the cosmopolitans to feel an obligation and sense of duty to the heartlanders. If cosmopolitans and heartlanders cease to identify with each other, our society will fall apart.  1999 Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development) Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 6 September, vol. 70, col. 2284 [W]hen the Prime Minister used the terms “cosmopolitans” and “heartlanders” of our population, he was referring to the outlook of two broad categories of people and reiterated that both were important to Singapore’s well being. Each has its own distinct contribution to our society. For example, the heartlanders play a major role in maintaining the core values and our social stability and give us our Singapore brand name. Cosmopolitans, on the other hand, extend our economic reach and help Singapore to run as an efficient, high performance society. We should not look at cosmopolitans and heartlanders in terms of socio-economic status as this is not an issue.  1999 Low Thia Khiang Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 6 September, vol. 70, col. 2284 Is the Minister aware that by the way the heartlanders and cosmopolitans are being portrayed and reported in the mass media, it has given rise to the perception or impression that cosmopolitans and heartlanders are two different classes of Singapore citizens in our society?  2005 Jeanine Tan Today, 10 May, 31 [A]n overenthusiastic heartlander exclaimed loudly that the gangly actress [Patricia Mok] was much prettier in the flesh when compared to her “ugly” screen image..

1991 B.G. George Yong-Boon Yeo (Acting Minister for Information and the Arts) Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 21 March, vol. 57, cols. 955–956 I remember having a conversation once with the CEO of Fuji Sankei, the largest Japanese TV company, Mr Shikanai. He said that the way he operated is like the way MITA operates. They combine information and culture together. Because he felt that for industry of the future, for competition in the future, the more the two gets entwined together, the more competitive you become. So he says it is not hardware, it is not software, in the end it is heartware. You are appealing not just to function, you are appealing also to people’s sensitivities. And I think this is the overall approach we should take towards the arts in Singapore, combining it into our economy, into our social life, so that it strengthens us in the long term, so that expenditure on the arts is no longer seen as consumption but as investment.  1997 Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 5 June, vol. 67, col. 405 The Government can provide the conditions for security and economic growth. But in the end, it is people who give feeling, a human touch, a sense of pride and achievement, the warmth. So beyond developing physical infrastructure and hardware, we need to develop our social infrastructure and software. In Sony Corporation, they call this “heartware”. We need to go beyond economic and material needs, and reorient society to meet the intellectual, emotional, spiritual, cultural and social needs of our people.  1998 Peh Chin Hwa Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 9 March, vol. 68, col. 616 The Government is also committed to studying how to improve the “heart-ware” simultaneously with the improvement to the hardware, so that the imported talents can integrate into the Singapore society, thereby remaining permanently in Singapore and make a contribution towards the development of Singapore.  1998 Ong Chit Chung Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 11 March, vol. 68, col. 912 Total defence is part and parcel of our national education. While we train our National Servicemen on how to use and maximise the hardware that we have, we must not forget the heartware. Each and every National Serviceman must know what he is fighting for, why the sacrifices, why we hold dear our sovereignty, integrity and independence and our hopes and visions for the future.  1998 Simon Tay Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 31 July, vol. 68, col. 693 We need to move towards consultation which we have seen, and from there, to a greater sense of participation. We need to build up Singapore’s heartware, we need to build up Singapore’s civil society. This is the utility of freeing people from the “black book” syndrome and encouraging their speech and participation, to give people a sense of ownership, that Singapore is their home. If it is our home, we must be comfortable here. We must be able to speak freely.  2002 Gan Kim Yong Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 1 October, vol. 75, col. 1114 [O]ver the last 30 years, we have built ourselves a world-class infrastructure. We have one of the world’s best airport and sea port. We have one of the most efficient transport and telecommunication system. We have the best hardware.

By day, they might seem like cocks on the walk at the parade square, but in those drunken evening gatherings, Djinn saw that they were vulnerable and bitter. Rightly or wrongly, they felt they had been marginalised by the influx of scholar soldiers whom the Government introduced by the mid-1970s. Without a piece of paper, they could not rise up the ranks. They saw themselves as failures, condemned to a life of hentak-kaki (Malay for marching on the spot, going nowhere).",,,

Dict.)) + Eng. festival; compare 鬼节 guǐ jié the festival of demons on the 15th of the seventh lunar month (Mathews)]  A Chinese festival, known in Mand. as 中元节 Zhōngyuán Jié [zhōng middle, mid + yuán first, primary + jié festival], marked on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month (August or September of the Gregorian calendar) which is held to pacify the souls of persons believed not to be properly cared for after their death, or of those who have died an unnatural death or who have had an improper or no burial. It is commemorated with ceremonies involving the offering of food and prayers; such ceremonies are often held outdoors to prevent wandering spirits from entering homes and causing disturbances in households. Other rituals associated with the festival and the whole of the seventh lunar month include the burning of replica paper money (Hell Money) and cars, houses and household items made of paper to enable spirits to live comfortably in hell; the lighting of lanterns to guide spirits to ceremonial feasts set out for them; and the holding of outdoor performances such as Getai and Chinese operas to entertain spirits and ensure that they do not cause trouble. The seventh lunar month is regarded as unlucky and thus to be avoided for events such as weddings, moving house or starting a new business.
¶ The Hungry Ghost Festival is believed to be of Buddhist and Taoist origin. A Skt. sutra attributed to the Buddha associated with the institution of the festival is that of the story of Mu Lan’s mother. While meditating, Mu Lan, a monk blessed with divine sight, discovered his deceased mother as a diseased hungry ghost. His attempts to feed her failed when the food he gave her became charcoal. Mu Lan petitioned the Buddha who advised that only the combined merit of all of the local monks could release his mother from her torment. Mu Lan was to offer a variety of foods and delicacies on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month on behalf of his mother and his family’s previous seven generations. The monks would accept these offerings and, by their joint virtues, Mu Lan’s ancestors would become deities. As a result of his actions Mu Lan’s mother was saved. Gratefully, he asked the Buddha if other filial sons should hold such a feast to save parents and restore them from otherwise horrid fates. Buddha responded that every year on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month they should remember their parents and ancestors with piety and compassion, and repay their parents for their care and love by preparing a feast for offering to the Buddha and the monks.
    The ghostly aspect of the seventh lunar month emerged from the Taoist concept of hell. Imprisoned in its lowest reaches, ghosts may leave hell only with special permission of its king. This privilege is granted only if a ghost receives no offerings to provide for its welfare, and therefore must return to the living to take what it can. Buddhism incorporated the Taoist hell into the tradition of the seventh month, known as 盂兰盆 Yúlánpén, derived from the Skt. ūrvulambana [उवऀ ūrva a receptacle (for water); a reservoir; a cloud; an enclosed space, a stable for cattle; a prison, captivity (?) < वृ vṛi  to screen, cover, cover over, conceal, hide; encompass, surround, envelop; to restrain, keep back, ward off; to prevent, impede, obstruct, hinder, check, stop; resist, confine + ळमबन lambana hanging down, depending, pendulous; causing to hang down < ळमब् lamb to hang down, depend, dangle, hang from, hang on or upon, depend on or from; sink, sink down, go down, decline, fall, set (as the sun) (Monier-Williams)], signifying the emptying out of hell, as one empties a bowl by turning it upside down. The Taoist version favored the term Putu, signifying a crossing over or a general amnesty for the souls of the dead in hell. This amnesty commences on the first day of the seventh lunar month when the gates of hell are opened and the ghosts are permitted to roam the earth looking for whatever food they may find. On the 15th day, the feeding of the souls is attended to and each family offers a banquet for the ghosts. By the 30th day the ghosts must return to hell.  See Darren A. Bryant, “Ancestors and Ghosts: The Philosophic and Religious Origins of the Hungry Ghost Festival” (1993, rev. 2001, accessed on 23 November 2008).
2001 Ong Siew Chey The Straits Times, 27 November, 16 The festival originated from Buddhism and not from Taoism. The legend was probably first recorded in the Tang Dynasty about 1,400 years ago, and was about Yu Lan Pen, or ‘extreme suffering’, in Sanskrit. It seemed that a woman, who had sinned in life, was suffering as a ‘hungry ghost’ in hell. Food brought near her mouth would immediately become burning coals. Her son Mu Lan, a devout Buddhist, attained deity status and was able to see his mother’s suffering. Through prayers and charitable work, he managed to save his mother from her terrible fate. This legend probably led to the practice of offering food to hungry ghosts at the Yu Lan Pen festival, on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month. How the festival became connected to Taoism is not clear. Perhaps it is because Taoism, as it is practised today, is mainly about the worship of a sundry collection of deities and dealing with the souls of the dead. It is understandable that the Hungry Ghost Festival turned into a Taoist practice. .. The Hungry Ghost Festival has evolved as a Singaporean tradition over the last 30 years to become a social occasion.  2006 Sarah Ng The Straits Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 29 June. The Hungry Ghost Festival is celebrated by Taoists and Buddhists, who believe that the gates of hell open every year during the seventh month of the lunar calendar to allow the souls of the dead to roam the earth. Businesses in real estate, home renovation and wedding banquets have been known to slow down during that period because of the belief that it is inauspicious to move house, renovate, or get married.  2006 Shen Shi’an The Straits Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 4 July. In the article, ‘Double ghost months send business jitters’ (ST, June 29), it was mentioned that ‘the Hungry Ghost Festival is celebrated by Taoists and Buddhists, who believe that the gates of Hell open every year during the seventh lunar month to allow the souls of the dead to roam the earth’. On behalf of the Buddhist community, I would like to point out three major errors in that statement. Firstly, Buddhists do not exactly celebrate during the entire seventh month, as the main celebration falls on the 15th day, which marks the Ullambana Festival. Instead of being inauspicious, this is an especially auspicious day for Buddhists as it historically coincides with Pravarana Day, the end of the annual rains retreat in the Buddha’s time. On this day, many monks and nuns who have attained enlightenment gather to announce to the Buddha their spiritual attainment. It is thus also known as ‘The Buddha’s Day of Rejoice’ [sic]. The Buddha encouraged the use of this special occasion to make various offerings to the noble monastic community and the less fortunate, so as to dedicate the garnered merits for the well-being of one’s deceased parents and relatives, some of whom might unfortunately have been reborn as hungry ghosts due to great craving. Prayers are also made by chanting to share Buddhist teachings with them. It is also encouraged to make offerings to create merits for one's living parents on this ‘Day of Filial Piety’. Secondly, in Buddhism, the gates of Hell do not open during the seventh month. The realm of hungry ghosts is distinct from the realm of hells, where suffering is generally without much respite, though never eternal, due to the limits of negative karma. However, hell beings can also benefit from merits dedicated to them to alleviate their suffering. Another distinction to be made is that of wandering spirits, who are beings so attached to their previous lives that they roam our world before finally being reborn. They, too, can benefit from merits created to guide them to better rebirths. Thirdly, there is no concept of ‘soul’ in Buddhism, as all beings are seen to have constantly changing consciousness or ‘mindstreams’, and are thus able to evolve spiritually for the better in terms of perfecting their compassion and wisdom. In the above sense, the seventh lunar month should have no ill effect for Buddhists, as we already co-exist with mostly unseen wandering spirits and hungry ghosts, while the realm of Hell is another world. However, when we make a fuss out of unseen beings, who are mostly harmless, supernatural incidents naturally seem to increase.  2006 Hong Xinyi The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 6 August, L6 The month-long festivities kick off every year in a desolate corner of Kallang Park, where the 200 or so members of the Singapore-Malaysia Getai Artistes Association mark the first day of the Hungry Ghost Festival with a midnight prayer ceremony under a makeshift tent. Taking place on July 25 this year, the getai folk burn hell money in a giant bin, praying for a safe and profitable seventh month. .. According to a Buddhist Sanskrit legend, Mu Lian, one of Buddha’s disciples, started offering food to monks to save his dead mother from suffering in hell. Buddhists mainly celebrate the seventh month on the 15th day, which marks an auspicious day known as the Ullambana Festival. Taoists believe that the 15th day of the seventh lunar month is the birthday of Ti-kuan Ta-ti (the Earth Deity), the Taoist deity with the power to pardon human sins. In Singapore, these religious beliefs have merged with folklore to create a festival rife with its own urban legends and rituals. Mothers warn children not to stay out late and to refrain from swimming, and the seventh month is also considered inauspicious for weddings and buying real estate. Sociologist Kwok Kian Woon, 50, believes these practices stem from “religious beliefs that are based on polydeism (the existence of many gods) and animism (the belief that spirits inhabit nature).”  L9 The central belief behind the Hungry Ghost festival is that the gates of hell open on the first day of the lunar seventh month, and all ghosts are allowed to wander the earth for one month before they have to return to the underworld again.",,,

This is a tale of two dumplings – sui kau and jiao zi. .. Jiao zi is less stuffed, but more thick-skinned. .. [J]iao zi sits happily on a plate and comes with vinegar on its side. .. [J]iao zi hails from mainland China. .. The steamed jiao zis (dumplings in Mandarin) at Tian Jin Fong Kee.. are simple yet satisfying. The taste of pork is not overpowering and the chives are a nice contrast in texture and flavour to the lean shoulder pork. Also, the floury skin used to wrap the meat is just nice, not too thick nor too thin. While its boss Fong William will not divulge what ingredients go into marinating the meat, the recipe is good enough to sell hundreds of plates of jiao zi each day. I also liked the vinegar used by Fong Kee, which is lighter than the versions I have tasted at other stalls. Vinegar is to dumplings what ketchup is to fries. It enhances the enjoyment of jiao zis and helps to reduce the rich meaty taste of pork. .. $6 at Tian Jin Fong Kee gets you 12 jiao zis. While the stall sells guo tie too (the same dumplings fried instead of steamed), bear in mind (and eventually your tummy) that fried dumplings contain 40 per cent more fat than steamed ones.  2007 Wong Ah Yoke The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 19 August, L27 [T]he dish comes with a jiao zhi [sic] (meat dumpling) instead of a xiao long bao..  2009 Mak Mun San The Sunday Times, 19 April, 29 On any given day, she would opt for a kick-ass Sichuan steamboat over a Peranakan meal, la mian (hand-pulled noodles) over bak chor mee, jiao zi (boiled dumplings) over rojak.",,,

When I was young, I used to see kachang puteh vendors in cinemas selling all sorts of nuts. But the most popular type had to be the white sugar-coated peanut. Maybe this was why the term “kachang puteh” was coined. Other than in cinemas, kachang puteh sellers could also be seen setting up shop by the street together with other street hawkers. Then, there were the Indian vendors who’d balance a wooden rack that was filled with kachang puteh on their heads, as they set about hawking the little delights.

I see the old lady as a karung guni or rag-and-bone trader. She plies a trade that many shun. She and her karung guni trade perform some important functions in society. .. The karung guni folk fill an environmental niche. Since the early days, they have been the country’s recycling backbone. Without their backbreaking toil to balance an increasingly affluent throwaway society, we would be incinerating and land-filling a lot more rubbish. Our karung guni folk work not for the sake of recycling. Their motivation is to earn a decent living by selling the recyclables. The work is very hard and the income can be irregular, but the buying and selling of used products afford the worker a livelihood. Many younger Singaporeans squirm at the thought of picking up other peoples’ discards and pushing a trolley load through a busy street. The karung guni is therefore an unrecognised group of steely entrepreneurs. As society develops and its people lead increasingly structured lives, the karung guni may one day become just another old story. Informal recycling by the rag-and-bone folk is progressively replaced by institutionalised recycling programmes.

The people we speak of as Klings cannot properly be called Hindus, as the majority in the Straits will, I believe, be found to be Mahommedans. This disposes of the religious name. (2.) They cannot be called Tamils, as very many, if not most of them, are Telugus (Telingana); thus language fails to meet the difficulty. (3.) Coromandels might be used, but this word is only known as a geographical expression by the Europeans. Natives of India do not use it, that I am aware of. (4.) Dravidians might meet the want of a common name (one in common I mean), but philologists would be horror-struck at the desecration of one of their pet words. Nor is it a word in common use among natives of India. We are thus compelled to fall back upon the despised word Kling, which, I think, may be satisfactorily accounted for on the following suppositions:– (1.) Penang was originally a part of the Bengal Presidency, or rather was ruled from Bengal. (2.) Officials from Bengal must have brought Bengali servants with them. (3.) These, when the first importations of natives of the south-east coast of India were brought over, would class them as Kaling; that is, as people coming from the districts known to them as Kaling, south of Bengal. (4.) The next step would be easy – Kaling has a short “a”; omit it altogether (there are many similar instances in philology), the result is Kling, applied to all natives south of Bengal. The above appears to me the probable derivation of the name as used here.  1955 R.J. Wilkinson A Malay–English Dictionary, vol. 1, 542 Keling.. Southern Indian; «Kling». Etym., «native of Kalinga» (a Telugu district, the Northern Circars); now used rather of Tamils. Originally a famous name; referred to in Asoka’s edicts, in the Singhalese Mahawansa, and even in Pliny (Hist. Nat. VI 18, 20; VII 2, – quoted by Yule). At present it is regarded rather as a term of abuse. Abdullah (a man of Indian descent) uses it of his own people, see Ht. Abd. [Hikayat Abdullah] 3, 14, 22; and speaks of the most learned man in Malacca as a pěranakan K. (Ht. Abd. 31). But even in the Malay Annals there are indications that the word had dubious associations: cheh Kěling tiada tahu bahasa (for shame, you mannerless Kling; Mal. Annals [Malay Annals]). Cf. also the passage where the captured king of Pahang describes scornfully as «this old Kling» the Dato’ Nara Diraja, the Indian founder of the great family from which the Sultans of Lingga, Singapore, Trengganu, Pahang and Johore claimed direct descent; Mal.

From the simple white rag of the nearly naked Kling, to the heavy flowing dress of the Mahommedan Hadjee, almost every shade of colour, and every variety of habit which it is possible to imagine, are here mingled together.  147 Next in the population tables of the Straits come the natives of India, chiefly Klings from Madras and the Coromandel coast, and Bengalese from Calcutta. The Klings are by far the most numerous, and are a conspicuous element in the population. .. The occupations sought by these people are numerous, and some of them distinct. They are traders, shopkeepers, cooks, boatmen, common labourers, hack-carriage runners, and washermen; the two latter occupations are almost entirely monopolized by them.  1869 Alfred Russel Wallace The Malay Archipelago, vol. 1, ch. 2, 31 The Klings of Western India are a numerous body of Mahometans, and, with many Arabs, are petty merchants and shopkeepers.  1890 Rudyard Kipling Barrack-Room Ballads (1892) 135 The frigate-bird shall carry my word to the Kling and the Orang-Laut.  1894 N.B.

Consequently, no sensible man who knows anything about the way the word is commonly used, would think of using it when addressing an audience of Tamils or Indians.  1968 Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. 13, 400, col. 1 In Malay usage ‘Kling’ carried associations of disparagement from the start. It.. was replaced by ‘Tamil’ early in the 20th century.  2000 Peter K.G. Dunlop Street Names of Singapore 53 The word ‘Kling’ was widely used in Singapore and Malaysia as a generic name for Indians, especially those from southern India. It comes from Kalinga, the powerful 14th century kingdom on India’s eastern coast, which was the first part of the sub-continent to export its culture to the Malay world.  2003 Earnest Lau Methodist Message, September, 4 ‘A Chinese Christian’ in the May 1915 Malaysia Message drew attention to the racial epithets used by certain missionaries, questioning the appropriateness of ‘Chinaman’ and ‘Kling’ to refer to Chinese and Tamils.  2003 Victor R. Savage & Brenda S.A. Yeoh, Toponymics 6–7 Kling Street (now Chulia Street): already extant on the earliest comprehensive plan of the town drawn from an actual survey, Kling Street was named after southern Indians known in Singapore as “Klings”, a Malay/Javanese corruption of Kalinga, the ancient empire of southern India which had trading connections of great antiquity with the Malay Archipelago. In nineteenth-century Singapore, “Orang Kling” was a bazaar Malay term which embraced southern Hindu Indians of all classes. After World War I, however, the leaders of the Indian community, and its English-educated members in particular, felt that the street-name Kling Street had taken on a degrading connotation which it had not had in the past, since the only class of people referred to as “Klings” after the war were the lowly Indian coolies (Peet, 1985:110). In 1918, Rev J.A.B. Coah wrote to the municipal commissioners suggesting that the name Kling Street be changed as it was “a cause of irritation to Indians” but the commissioners saw no reason to discard what they felt was an historical name. The commissioners, however, yielded to increasing pressure to comply with the feelings of the Indian community three years later, and Kling Street was rechristened Chulia Street, on the motion of Dr H.S. Moonshi, one of the Indian members of the Board.  91 Chulia Street was formerly known as Kling Street because of the concentration of Indians from southern India, who were known as “men from Kalinga” or in Malay, orang kling. Kling Street was one of the early streets of Singapore, developed probably in the early 1820s, and appears in Coleman’s 1836 Map of Singapore. It is the only spatial reference to the presence of this Indian community on the modern landscape. When Indian convicts were transported to Singapore, Kling had a derogatory association and hence the name Kling was dropped and replaced with Chulia, a reference no doubt to the Chulias from India who were concentrated in this area (the North Indian term for the Kalinga kingdom is Chulia).  2005 Janadas Devan The Sunday Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 12 June. .. Chulia Street, called Kling Street once because Indians from southern India, known as ‘men from Kalinga’, or orang kling in Malay, lived there. Kalinga, an ancient southern Indian state, was corrupted into kling long before Indians arrived in Malaya. By 1918, however, kling had become derogatory, so Kling Street was changed to Chulia Street, with nobody seeming to mind that Chulia was just the northern Indian term for Kalinga.",,,

Unshaken in the belief that he was marketing a product of the utmost quality, Stuart pressed on. He believed that there was value in sanitary milk at a time when fresh milk was neither universally available nor always drinkable. He believed that his product would soon join other staples on the grocer’s shelves, such as salt and sugar. As sales began to grow, E.A. Stuart searched for the perfect name for his product. He literally stumbled across the solution while walking in downtown Seattle. Stuart passed a tobacconist’s window with cigars on display around a sign proclaiming their name – CARNATION.

2004 Arlina Arshad The Straits Times, 18 January, 6 The slaughtering of sheep, or korban, is carried out to remind Muslims of the need to give their wealth to Allah and to reinforce the practice of sharing what one has with the less fortunate.  2004 Tan Hui Yee & Alexis Hooi The Straits Times, 22 January, 2 While many mosques here had to postpone the Hari Raya Haji ritual of slaughtering sheep or goats yesterday, Omar Kampong Melaka Mosque was able to carry out the Korban as it had made its own arrangements to bring in animals to be sacrificed. The oldest mosque in Singapore was one of eight with their own suppliers. The other 39 here which conduct the ritual, ordered sheep through the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis). .. Bad weather and refuelling problems held up their delivery. .. [Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim] stressed that performing the Korban tomorrow does not violate Islamic principles, as the ritual can be conducted within four days from Hari Raya Haji morning. According to Islamic beliefs, Prophet Ibrahim was about to obey God’s commandment to sacrifice his son Ismail when God substituted a ram at the last moment. The Korban is performed annually to commemorate this event.  2006 Arlina Arshad The Straits Times, 7 January, H4 Korban, the slaughtering of sheep, is carried out to remind Muslims of the need to distribute their wealth in the name of God and to reinforce the practice of sharing one’s possessions with the less fortunate. The sacrifice is typically carried out on Hari Raya Aidiladha, also known as the Great Day of the Haj, which marks the end of the pilgrimage season to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. .. The ritual commemorates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, in obedience to God. In recognition of Abraham’s faith, Ishmael was spared when a ram appeared to take his place. Korban is carried out in many mosques throughout the world. In Singapore, it is carried out at some mosques and designated places. Although it is not compulsory to for Muslims to offer a sheep in sacrifice, those who can afford it are encouraged to do so. The sheep, which were shipped here from Australia, will be delivered to the mosques in trucks. Volunteers and professional butchers recite prayers as the sheep are slaughtered. The meat is then packed and distributed to Muslims who bought the sheep and to the poor and needy.  2006 Lim Wei Chean & Lee Hui Chieh (quoting Ilan Ben-Dove) The Straits Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 11 January. ‘The process of creating the halal meat is very similar, practically the same for kosher meat in the Jewish religion,’ he said. ‘As a matter of fact, the word korban, we use it in the Hebrew language too.’  2006 Shaik Kadir Shaik Maideen The Straits Times, 30 December, S10 The special feature of Eid ul-Adha, commonly called Hari Raya Haji in Malay, is the korban. As well as sheep, cattle and camels can also be slaughtered for their meat. Korban is not compulsory on either haj pilgrims or other Muslims. It is merely a recommended voluntary act of piety for those who can afford it. The Quran says: “It is not (the animal’s) flesh or blood that reaches God. It is your piety that reaches Him.” Korban activities in Singapore are undertaken by Muslim organisations and mosques. Muslims who wish to offer korban would have to have placed their order a couple of months ago. The sheep, mostly from Australia, arrive at least a couple of days before Hari Raya Haji. They are slaughtered according to Islamic law, without inflicting any cruelty on them. The korban ritual has a twofold objective. First, it is an act of piety as the meat is distributed to the poor. .. Second, korban services enable Muslim organisations and mosques to raise funds for their upkeep and educational programmes.",,,

Those afflicted presented with a picture of having experienced a sudden feeling of retraction of the penis, and were beset with a great fear that should the retraction be permitted to proceed, the penis would eventually be drawn into the abdomen with a fatal outcome. In their anxiety to prevent such a mishap, they held on to their penis either manually or with instrumental aid. In some instances, relatives took turn to hold on to the penis to curb its supposed “wanderings”, in others, a clamp, a cloth peg, a loop of string, or even a safety pin was employed to restrain the recalcitrant member. .. In spite of the fears, however, a fatal outcome was unknown, although many instances of trauma to the penis, in some cases quite severe, had been seen. It is also generally accepted that this is a form of neurosis although the psychodynamics are not clearly known and the natural history of the complaint has not been worked out.  120, col. 1 Koro may be derived from the Malay word “Kuru” meaning to shake, but the real origin was not ascertainable locally from Malay scholars. On the other hand, the Chinese terms “Shook Yang”, “Shook Jong” have been in use for some time, and in a book known as New Collection of remedies of value (驗方新篇) [footnote deleted] allusion is made to the term “縮陽” (Shook Yang), also referred to as Yin type of cold affliction (陰症傷寒).  120, col. 2 In Singapore and Malaya, cases of this nature are frequently seen practically all in the Chinese, and a patient may have one attack only, or several recurring ones. No fatality has been observed, although instances of sudden death during intercourse were frequently cited as being due to the complaint. .. From the three cases reported above, and the information gleaned locally, it seems reasonable to assume that Koro or “Shook Yang” is an acute hysterical panic reaction arising as a result of a deluded belief which has been current in folklore. The patient learns through hearsay that the retraction of the penis can result in death; and under circumstances favourable to the development of the condition, the slightest subjective feeling in the genitalia sets in motion the fear that this particular complaint is afoot! Thereupon, he grasp [sic] his penis and summons aid, and the mounting anxiety together with a sympathetic crowd of relatives sharing a common belief does the rest.  1969 Koro Study Team (chairman: Gwee Ah Leng) Singapore Medical Journal, December, vol. 10, no. 4, 234 The Koro “epidemic” in Singapore [title] Koro, a disease characterised by the sudden delusion of penis retracting, was a well-known entity and has been previously reported in Singapore (Gwee, 1963). Its occurrence was sporadic, and mostly in association with sexual activity. It was known to the Chinese as Shook yang and it had been pointed out that this had been recorded as an entity in one of the oldest medical literature in Chinese medicine (Gwee, 1968). In Singapore, it is seen to affect Chinese men more than others, and it has been suggested that the entity arose first of all from the association of fatal illnesses with penile retraction, a phenomenon not uncommonly seen at death, and then from the cultural belief of the importance of the genitalia in relation to life, the systematisation was made that the penile retraction in fact was the cause and not the effect of death (Gwee, 1963). The result is then a delusion of penile retraction followed by a fear of imminent death resulting in acute anxiety amounting to panic, and remedial measures adopted sometimes resulted in trauma to the genitalia. Other views of the entity ranged from sexual neurosis to depersonalisation syndrome.. On 29th October 1967, Koro first gained attention by a newspaper report where in it was stated that some people, as a result of eating the flesh of pigs inoculated with anti-swine-fever vaccine, developed Koro, and had to be treated by doctors or other home remedies. The report was elaborated within a few days with further embellishments alleging that a pig after inoculation had died with penile retraction. Rumour was rife that the flesh of pigs inoculated with vaccine was unwholesome, and when consumed would cause Koro, which could be a killing disease. The pork sales began to go down, and further reports in the news carried increasing incidence of cases treated by doctors and Chinese physicians, and also accounts were published of at least one doctor and several Chinese physicians regarding the disease, chiefly emphasising that it should be treated quickly, and effectively with injections, acupuncture and other measures.  240 Previously, it was suggested that Koro was a panic state arising out of a delusory belief based on cultural indoctrination (Gwee, 1963). The indoctrination provided the belief that it was possible to get a shrinking of the genitals with fatal results, and given the right stimulus, in this particular instance the eating of pork from inoculated pigs, the belief culminated in a panic syndrome. The present epidemic therefore would seem to substantiate this postulate. The ease with which the epidemic was suppressed with published authoritative pronouncements and the effectiveness of cure in individual cases would also suggest that what is at work here is not infection but a mental state caused by rumours.",,,

Once you’ve had laksa – a spicy Peranakan (Chinese/Malaysian) noodle soup – for breakfast, bacon and eggs become completely inadequate. It usually consists of seafood, rice noodles, fried bean curd, coconut milk and lots of chilies. The word “laksa” is said to have come from the Sanskrit word for “many,” referring to its many ingredients, but it might as well have referred to its many versions. The one at Sungei Road, though less fiery than the Borneo variety, is still a spicy hellbroth of fresh cockles, slices of fish cake and beehoon noodles in coconut milk, seasoned with garlic, red chilies, belacan (dried shrimp paste), lemongrass, galangal root and turmeric. It’s a classic “hurt so good” experience, requiring only a spoon – and a towel to mop the sweat from your face. For some time, I sat alone enjoying the sweet, relative coolness of the coconut milk against the sting of the chilies, with hearty bass notes of seafood and shrimp paste, while happily watching the morning commuters and fellow devotees slurping their breakfasts around me.",,,

Daun kesum is one of the many herbs that make up a Malay ulam (fresh herbs and greens) platter. In many Malay and Peranakan dishes, for example Penang laksa, nasi ulam and udang masak nenas, it is used to complement seafood.

Habibie: What I meant by little ‘red dot’ [title] Former Indonesian president B.J. Habibie yesterday gave a fresh take on his famous 1998 reference to Singapore as a little ‘red dot’. .. He told reporters that far from dismissing tiny Singapore, he had meant to highlight Singapore’s achievements despite its small size. He said that he had made the remark while speaking off-the-cuff with members of an Indonesian youth group and trying to ‘give them spirit’. He said he told them: ‘If you look at the map of South-east Asia, you (Indonesia) are so big, and Singapore is just a dot. But if you come to Singapore, you see people with vision.’ Although he meant for the youngsters to learn from Singapore, his remarks did not go down well here. ‘But of course at that time people didn’t like me...and I have corrected many times, but they have never put it,’ he said with a laugh. ‘And I could not prove it in writing because I was talking freely.’ Dr Habibie’s ‘red dot’ remark caused an outcry when it was first published as part of an interview with the Asian Wall Street Journal in August 1998. It was seen as a dismissal of Singapore. It has since become a point of pride and amusement with Singaporeans.

Better known as Mat Salleh, he initiated nationalistic fervour and opposition to foreign rule. Between 1881 and 1941, Sabah, then known as North Borneo, was under the London-based British North Borneo Chartered Company's administration. The locals were unhappy due to alleged exploitation and one man that stood up and led a rebellion against British rule was Datu Paduka Muhammad Salleh better known as Mat Salleh. To the British, he was a rebel but to locals, he was a warrior. He was killed in a gun battle with the British police on Feb 1, 1900. Appropriately, in recognition of Mat Salleh as one of Sabah’s earliest freedom fighters, the State Government built a permanent memorial fort in a garden at the exact site where he was killed at Kampung Tibabar in Tambunan. .. Outside the memorial, a monument with a bronze plaque with a citation reads: “This plaque marks the site of Mat Salleh’s Fort which was captured by the North Borneo Armed Constabulary on the 1st February 1900. During this engagement, Mat Salleh, who for six years led a rebellion against the British Chartered Company administration, met his death.” Sabah Museum director Joseph Pounis Guntavid said the British had put up the monument in remembrance of their success in ending the reign of Mat Salleh’s rebellion to their rule. “But a search and study on Mat Salleh’s actions strongly indicated that he was not a rebel but a warrior who went against foreign rule, fighting for North Borneo’s self-government,” he said.

2005 Theresa Tan The Straits Times (Mind Your Body), 28 December, 13 I always thought mee siam was a Malay dish, until I did this review. Originally a Thai invention (Siam is the old name for Thailand), the dish has become a Nonya speciality cooked by Malays, Indians and Chinese hawkers here. Mr Chew Keok Lye is a Chinese hawker who learnt how to make this dish from one of his Malay friends two decades ago and continues to improvise the recipe till this day. His version is light, tasty and, best of all, not oily at all. This is because Mr Chew boils the vermicelli, instead of frying it like most hawkers do. The piquant gravy is made from a blend of dried shrimps, tamarind juice, bean paste, ginger, garlic, onions and lemongrass. The first three items are a must, says Mr Chew, to get the unique sweet, sour and salty taste. .. It is served with the usual dried beancurd, beansprouts and egg.  2011 Lee Hui Chieh The Straits Times (Mind Your Body), 21 July, 22 Brown rice vermicelli had been drenched in a tangy gravy and topped with half a hard-boiled egg, cubes of fried tau kwa (firm soya bean curd), spring onion and a generous dollop of sambal chilli, to make the mee siam.

A common option at fishball noodle stalls, bee tai mak can also be used in any dish calling for fresh rice noodles, such as laksa, beef noodles and Vietnamese noodle soups. There’s no logical reason you couldn't also eat them in mee siam, curry mee or with kway chap gravy, say, though bear in mind that they are more rustic than delicate in texture.  2008 Huang Lijie The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 12 October, 31 It may be short, stubby, and until recently, enjoyed mostly by children, but the noodle mee tai mak is making a gastronomic comeback. Once a staple in Teochew minced meat noodles and fishball noodles, it is winning new fans with its multiple reincarnations in laksa, XO sauce noodles and even the Peranakan meatball soup, bakwan kepiting. According to Mr Ho Nyi Sing, 60, owner of Eng Heng Noodle Factory, which manufactures mee tai mak, the noodle’s name in Teochew refers to the sieve-like basket that was used in the past to make it. The noodle also goes by its Cantonese monicker [sic], lo shi fun, or literally, rat noodles, because its cylindrical shape with pointed ends is said to resemble the rodent’s tail. Mr Raymond Tan, 36, director of Tan Seng Kee Foods, a noodle manufacturer here which has been making mee tai mak for more than 70 years, says the noodle enjoyed a brief surge of popularity in the early 1980s.

The Merlion statue was Mr Lim’s pride. ‘Even after completion, my father would visit the Merlion almost every day,’ says Peter. ‘When the Merlion couldn’t spurt water properly, he would be the first to call the authorities,’ adds Albert. Mr Lim even considered the Merlion his ninth child.  2005 Singapore Tourism Board website <http://app.stb.com.sg/asp/form/form01.asp>. At the end of the 4th century A.D., Temasek was destroyed by the Siamese, according to some historians, but by the Javanese according to others. As recorded in the legend in the Malay Annals, Prince Nila Utama of the Sri Vijaya empire rediscovered the island later in the 11th century A.D. On seeing a strange beast (which he later learnt was a lion) upon his landing he named the island Singapura which is a Sanskrit word for Lion (Singa) City (Pura). The Merlion, with its fish-like body riding the waves of the sea, is symbolic of the ancient city of Temasek. At the same time, its majestic head recalls the legend of the discovery of Singapore by Prince Nila Utama in the 11th century, when Singapore received its present name. .. The Merlion was first built as an eight-metre tall sculpture in 1972 and was located at the mouth of the Singapore River to “welcome all visitors to Singapore”. Built by a local craftsman, Lim Nang Seng, who won several prizes in the Singapore Handicraft and Design competition organised by the Singapore Tourism Board (then known as the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board) in 1970, it was commissioned for approximately $165,000 in 1971, and formally installed on 15 September 1972 by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the then Prime Minister. The Merlion, a symbol to welcome all visitors to Singapore, has since moved. On 15 September 2002, it settled into its new home at Merlion Park, located next to One Fullerton, overlooking scenic Marina Bay, with the park opened by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.  2006 Kate Smith Today (from Todayonline.com), 20 June.

1002,"Mid-Autumn Festival n. [Eng. transl. of Mand. 中秋节 Zhōngqīu Jié: zhōng middle, mid + qīu autumn + jié festival]  A Chinese festival held on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month (usu. in mid- to late-September of the Gregorian calendar) around the date when the moon is at its fullest in the year. Traditions associated with the festival include appreciating the beauty of the moon [Mand. 赏月 shǎngyuè: shǎng admire, enjoy, appreciate + yuè the moon] in the open air; the preparation, giving and eating of Mooncakes and pomelos; and the carrying of lanterns by children.  Also known as the Lantern Festival 2.
¶ The festival may have originated from mid-autumn harvest celebrations, or from ancient ceremonies held in honour of the moon or the moon goddess, Cháng’é 嫦娥. It appears that the latter custom can be traced as far back as the ancient Xia Dynasty [Mand. 夏朝 Xìa Cháo] (c.2070–1600 b.c.) and Shang Dynasty [Mand. 商朝 Shāng Cháo] (c.1600–1046 b.c.). There are varying accounts of the Chinese legend of Chang’e, but one version known at least since the Period of the Warring States [Mand. 战国 Zhàn Guó] (475–221 b.c.) is that Chang’e and Houyi were immortals in heaven. The ten sons of the Jade Emperor [Mand. 玉皇大帝 Yǜ Huáng Dà Dì], the ruler of heaven, transformed themselves into ten suns, scorching the earth. Having failed to stop his sons from destroying the earth, the Jade Emperor summoned Houyi for help. Houyi, using his archery skills, shot down nine of the suns, becoming a hero. This aroused the jealousy of some immortals, who slandered Houyi before the Jade Emperor. The Jade Emperor thus banished Houyi and Chang’e to live as mortals on earth.
     This version of the legend goes on to state that Houyi, sorry that Chang’e had to lead a mortal’s life for his sake, went on a long and perilous journey to obtain a pill of immortality the Queen Mother of the West [Mand. 西王母 Xī Wáng Mǔ], the ruler of the western paradise and the goddess of immortality, so that he and Chang’e would be able to live together for eternity. The Queen Mother warned him that each of them would only need half of the pill to become immortal. Houyi asked Chang’e not to open the case in which the pill was kept. One day, when Houyi was not at home, Chang’e’s curiosity overcame her. She opened the case and found the pill just as Houyi was returning home. Afraid that Houyi would catch her discovering the contents of the case, she swallowed the whole pill. This caused her to float into the sky until she landed on the moon, whereupon she became the moon goddess. According to another version of the legend, Houyi became a tyrannical leader and obtained an elixir of immortality for himself. Chang’e, not wishing the people to suffer under Houyi’s rule for eternity, drank the elixir herself and floated to the moon.
     The Mid-Autumn Festival increased in popularity during the Ming Dynasty [Mand. 明朝 Míng Cháo] (1368–1644) and Qing Dynasty [Mand. 清朝 Qīng Cháo] (1644–1911), possibly because of the success of a plan by Liu Powen, a military advisor to rebel army leader Chu Yuanchang, to use mooncakes to smuggle messages in uprisings to overthrow the Mongol rulers of the Yuan Dynasty [Mand. 元朝 Yuán Cháo] (1271–1368).

2005 Teo Pau Lin The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 3 April, L26 Ming jiang kueh, the peanut-filled pancake from the days of our grandparents, has been enjoying a revival of late. .. Widely known to have originated from China’s Guangdong province, the snack was brought by Chinese immigrants to places like Singapore, Sabah, Penang and Jakarta from the turn of the 20th century. Translated literally, ming jiang kueh is Teochew for “flour pan-fried cake”. It is pronounced as mang chang kueh in Hokkien. .. [H]ow does the new breed of ming jiang kueh actually taste? Done the old-fashioned way, the new chains cook their pancakes fresh on the spot using big, round iron pans. Then, they spread on the peanut and sugar filling, flip half of the pancake over, and cut in into slices.  2006 Hannah Tan The Sunday Times (LifeStyle) (from Straits Times Interactive), 4 June.

¶ The custom of exchanging mooncakes as gifts during the Mid-Autumn Festival appears to have originated during the Southern Song Dynasty [Mand. 南宋朝 Nán Sòng Cháo] (1127–1279).
2000 Josephine James The Straits Times, 11 September, 37 Zhong Qiu Jie, celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth month in the Chinese calendar, is believed to have originated as a festivity marking the harvest season. .. People would drink wine and eat mooncakes while admiring the moon, which was at its biggest and brightest. .. Mooncakes, pomelos and tea are traditional gifts of the season. The round cakes symbolise the moon and family reunions. Mooncakes have also been used to advantage in revolutions. In the 1300s, when the Hans were oppressed by the Mongols, the mooncake was used to call people to take up arms through concealed slips of paper.  2004 Joyce Teo The Straits Times, 28 September, H1 Two legends lay claim to the mooncake tradition. One is to celebrate legendary beauty Chang-Er, who flew to the moon. Another holds that mooncakes were first used to hold secret messages that began the revolution which ended the Yuan Dynasty in the 14th century.  2006 Clarissa Oon (quoting Lu Jichun) The Straits Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 10 June. When children today think of the Dragon Boat Festival, all they can think of is eating zongzi. For the Mid-Autumn Festival, they can only think of eating mooncakes.  2006 Teo Pau Lin The Sunday Times (LifeStyle) (from Straits Times Interactive), 10 September. Mr Tan Chock Soon gets incensed each time the annual Mid-Autumn Festival rolls around. He likes his mooncakes made the traditional way – plain lotus seed paste with one salted egg yolk. But each year, he is greeted by newfangled flavours that get ever more bewildering. ‘Ice cream, durian, wasabi, is there really a need to be so modern?’ asks Mr Tan.. Hand-made mooncakes have thinner and softer skins, because they are individually wrapped by hand around fillings, before they are shaped inside wooden moulds and baked. .. Opened about 70 years ago in Chinatown, this old-world shop [Tai Chong Kok] specialises in Cantonese-style pastries. During Mid-Autumn Festival, its Cantonese-style mooncakes – the type with lotus seed paste wrapped with a thin layer of baked skin – attracts long queues. .. It also sells snowskin versions and filling options include red bean paste and green bean paste. .. This 60-year-old bakery [Thye Moh Chan Cake House] specialises in Teochew-style mooncakes, which are characterised by their flaky skins. They come in three different sizes. The small ones.. are filled with a mixture of candied winter melon, sesame seeds, orange peel and red bean. The medium ones.. are about the size of your open palm, and are filled with the same mixture. There is a durian option, too.. The largest one.. is flat and only 1cm thick, filled with chewy malt sugar paste. .. Hokkien-style mooncakes.. are similar to the Cantonese ‘wife biscuit’, filled with candied winter melon paste and have a slightly salty taste..",,,

Roti prata and nasi briyani are so ubiquitous in Singapore and Malaysia that one easily falls into the belief that they originated in this part of the world. But the fact is that both dishes were brought here from India by early immigrants. The versions that most Singaporeans are familiar with, however, are slightly different from what one finds in India today as the recipes evolved separately over the centuries. This bit of information was brought to my attention recently at a lunch at Spice Junction, a six-month-old restaurant in Race Course Road. The eatery specialises in food from Kerala, a state on the south-western coast of the sub-continent.. Briyani is called biriyani here, and comes in three variations – Malabar chicken biriyani ($8.90), Malabar mutton biriyani ($9.90) and Malabar prawn biriyani ($10.90). These are what we call dum briyani, where the meat or seafood is slow-cooked with basmati rice in a small brass container. The usual briyani here has the meat and rice cooked separately. The biriyani also does not have the bright yellow colour of the Singaporean briyani that comes from turmeric. Instead, the soft and moist white rice gets its tasty flavours directly from the meat.

There are several explanations as to how the Kitchen God came to be, the most popular being that he was once a mortal named Zhāng Dān or Zhāng Zǐguō [Mand. 张单 or 张子郭] married to a virtuous woman. However Zhang Dan abandoned his wife for a young maiden. For this betrayal he was struck blind. His paramour left him and he became a beggar. One day, while begging for alms, he happened across the home of his former wife. Due to his blindness he did not recognise her. Despite the way he had treated her, Zhang Dan’s wife took pity on him and invited him in. She tended to him lovingly and cooked him a fabulous meal. He related to her his sorry tale and, as he began to cry, his eyesight was miraculously restored. Recognising his benefactress as his former wife he was overcome with shame and threw himself into the kitchen hearth. His wife tried to put out the fire but he was consumed by the flames and all that was left of him was a leg (to this day in China a fire poker is sometimes called ‘Zhang Dan’s Leg’). His wife then created a shrine to him above the hearth. Upon hearing the story, the Jade Emperor [Mand. 玉皇大帝 Yǜ Huáng Dàdì], the King of Heaven, decided to reward Zhang Dan for admitting to his wrongdoings by making him the Kitchen God and charging with watching over the behaviour of every household.
     In traditional Chinese belief, the Kitchen God returns to heaven on the 23rd day of the 12th month of the lunar calendar, one week before the Chinese New Year, to render a report on the behaviour of the household during the year. An unfavourable report causes the household to suffer from bad luck during the year to come. To ensure that the Kitchen God only speaks sweet words or to prevent him from opening his mouth altogether, honey or nian gao is smeared on the lips of an image of the Kitchen God on a poster mounted in the kitchen of the house. Offerings of food and incense are also made to the Kitchen God on his birthday, said to be on the third day of the eighth lunar month, and also on the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month.

2006 Teo Pau Lin The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 12 February. Opeh leaf, the beige, papery sheet that was used to wrap food packets in the 1940s to 1970s, has become a common sight in hawker centres islandwide. It had almost disappeared from Singapore’s foodscape in the past 30 years when hawkers switched to using cheaper and more convenient plastic-lined paper packaging. You could find it only in a few zi char stalls (hawkers serving restaurant-style food) that continued to use the leaf for takeaways because its subtle, woody fragrance seeps into the food and enhances its taste. But now, an increasing number of hawkers have turned to it again to wrap takeaways of Hokkien mee, char kway teow and oyster omelette. Many even use it to line the plates of dine-in orders. .. Opeh leaf comes from the betel nut palm (Areca catechu), a tree that grows in hot and humid tropical regions in the world, says Dr Chin See Chung, director of the Botanic Gardens. Tough and durable, it is the inner sheath of its bark, which falls off the tree about once a month. It comes in various sizes depending on the size of the tree. The fallen bark is collected, then its inner sheath is removed, dried and sold. .. Mr Sam Pang, 40, the co-owner of Lao Fu Zi, says the leaf was commonly used to pack chee cheong fun and Hokkien mee in the post-war decades. These dishes, which come with gravy, are most suitable to be wrapped in opeh leaves because the wetness absorbs their fragrance well, he says. Other recommended dishes include fried hor fun, Chinese-style pork chop and even chilli crab. In Malaysia, opeh leaf is also commonly used to wrap sweet Malay kuih. Mr Pang says that Singapore re-discovered it in the late 1990s, thanks to the slew of local TV programmes that recommended the best hawker finds in town. 2011 Eunice Quek & Lua Jia Min The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 17 April, 22 Fatty Weng in Guillemard Road.. still uses opeh (betel nut palm) leaves to pack food for takeaway..",,,

1964 Poh Ber Liak Legislative Assembly Debates: Official Report, 12 November, vol. 23, col. 399 There are more and more hawkers in pasar malam. Why should that be so? It is because many workers have to leave their factories, and in order to earn a minimum livelihood, they have no alternative but to buy some goods and sell them at the pasar malam. Or some of the shopkeepers, because of business failure, have to sell their goods on tricycles in the night markets. As a result of this, there are more and more hawkers in the pasar malam and less and less shopkeepers.  1977 Augustine H.H. Tan Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 16 February, vol. 36, cols. 240–241 Sometime last year I heard that the Hawkers’ Department intends to phase out Pasar Malam sites. I think it would be a pity to phase out what has become a colourful feature of our night life. Sir, even in advanced countries, bazaars are popular and colourful events. We should not be over-anxious to establish such an orderly existence that life loses some of its colour, Furthermore, Pasar Malam allows hawkers that extra elbowroom to earn that extra margin that makes life more tolerable. Already the urbanisation and rapid development of Singapore has unsettled lives and removed some traditional means of livelihood. We should therefore make every effort to provide a little leeway for small enterprises.  1985 Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 30 August, vol. 46, cols. 275–276 The pasar malam at the Singapore Handicraft Centre was introduced by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board in April this year. .. A total of 81 stallholders and demonstrators of vanishing trades operate at the pasar malam. Items sold include works of art, handicrafts and souvenirs. In addition, on-the-spot art demonstrations and handicraft making demonstrations are also featured. To complement the pasar malam activities and create a festive atmosphere, cultural and contemporary entertainment are also regularly featured. In our assessment, the pasar malam at the Singapore Handicraft Centre has been a success. Firstly, it is a good crowd drawer. .. Secondly, many visitors, especially tourists, have expressed satisfaction with the pasar malam as they find it a unique style of shopping.

This is similar to street hawking. As a policy, the Ministry does not allow or encourage such activity. However, exceptions have been made for the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board to hold sales of goods for tourists at the Singapore River during festival periods. Permission was also given to STPB to hold sales of goods within the courtyard of the Singapore Handicraft Centre as this is not tantamount to street hawking. Street hawking in HDB estates cannot be permitted.

Dennys A Descriptive Dictionary of British Malaya 74 Chinese emigration differs in two material respects from other emigration – that it consists mainly of adult males, to the exclusion of women and children, and that it never embraces either the upper or middle classes. The settlers, whenever it is in their power, form connections with the native women of the country; and hence has arisen a mixed race, numerous in the older Settlements, known to the Malays under the name of Peranakan China, literally, “Chinese of the womb,” that is, Chinese by native mothers. These intermarrying, either among themselves or with native Chinese, a race of quadroons, and almost of creoles, has sprung up, differing from the original Chinese – perhaps somewhat less energetic, but always possessed of more local knowledge.  1999 Lynn Pan (ed.) The Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas 202 Later, the local-born descendants of China-born settlers in the Straits Settlements would also be considered ‘Straits-born’, especially if they married into Straits Chinese families or became increasingly adapted to local ways. Straits Chinese were known as Babas if male, and Nyonyas if female. Alternatively, Babas were referred to by the term used for the local-born in the Dutch territories, including the Riau islands. One Singaporean commentator, Lim Boon Keng.. described Chinese Peranakans as ‘a new race… created by the fusion of Chinese and Malay blood,’ and there was indeed some intermarriage between Chinese men and local women. Lim also observed that Peranakans has [sic] ‘lost touch with China in every respect, except that they continued to uphold Chinese customs, and to practise, in variously modified forms, the social and religious practices of their forefathers.’ But their modification of such practices and the fact that their speech was a patois combining Chinese and Malay led Lim to consider them ‘a class by themselves.’  2006 Eveline Gan Weekend Today, 22–23 July, 23 Like most food-proud Peranakans, owners Mr and Mrs Kelvin Lee are extremely finicky about what goes into their food.

The National University of Singapore (NUS) received this unusual request from the daughter of the late Malaysian Chinese Association founder Tun Tan Cheng Lock. Miss Agnes Tan, 85, asked NUS to acquire a traditional Peranakan house along Neil Road, near Singapore General Hospital, and two shophouses in Malacca. She wants them to be used to teach young Singaporeans about Peranakan history, culture and architecture. .. Miss Tan’s nephew, Mr Peter Lee, will be the honorary curator of the Neil Road house, which may have a local Peranakan bibik (old lady) impersonator to act as a live-in housekeeper. NUS architecture dons, who described the pre-war Neil Road house as ‘one of the last remaining authentic Peranakan houses in Singapore’, said it will be restored and preserved as a unique architectural gem. The total cost: $4 million. Besides being a museum of Peranakan history, architecture and artefacts, there are plans to turn the three-storey house into a centre for exhibitions, talks and performances. NUS Development Office director Chew Kheng Chuan described the house as an unusual but ‘charming’ gift. ‘This gift is not about bricks and mortar.

National identity has been reshaped to serve economic and political goals, with the state itself becoming the determinant and arbiter of acceptable ethnic identities and their expressions, such as the enforced diminution of the Malay heritage of Peranakan Chinese and of the dialect heritage of the majority non-Mandarin-speaking Chinese.  2006 Eveline Gan Weekend Today, 22–23 July, 23–24 A marriage of both Chinese and Malay influences, Peranakan cuisine is unique to the culture of the immigrant Chinese community that made the Straits Settlements their home in the 19th century. Those unfamiliar with this eclectic cuisine may have the misconception that it is usually spicy. Truth is, there are also many Nonya dishes which are gentle on the palate.  2006 Stephanie Yap (quoting Desmond Sim), The Straits Times (Life!) (from Straits Times Interactive), 20 November.

The Peranakan Chinese trace their ancestry back to Chinese male immigrants from Fujian province who travelled to the Straits Settlements and married local Malay women. Three major groups of Peranakan Chinese are found in Penang, Malacca and Singapore. Despite sharing a similar heritage, the cuisines of the groups differ slightly from region to region. Penang Peranakan food, for example, carries certain Thai influences. A good example is its well-developed range of hot and sour salads, which is shared by Thai cuisine. Malacca Peranakan food, on the other hand, uses fish more than it does chicken or port as Malacca is near the coast. Singapore Peranakan food is perhaps best distinguished by the dish chicken buah keluak or chicken with black nuts.

1182,"Pinkerton Syndrome n. [Eng. < the character of Lieutenant Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton in the opera Madama Butterfly (1904) by Italian composer Giacomo Puccini (1858–1924)]  The tendency (perceived to be possessed by Asian Singaporeans in particular) to be favourably disposed towards, or prejudiced in favour of, Caucasians to the detriment of persons of other ethnic origin.
¶ In Madama Butterfly, Pinkerton, an officer of the United States Navy stationed in Japan, arranges a marriage to a Japanese geisha girl, Cio-Cio-San, known as Butterfly. He goes through a wedding ceremony with her but then returns to America, leaving the faithful Butterfly who, unknown to him, bears his son. Butterfly refuses to believe that Pinkerton has abandoned her. Three years later he returns to Japan with a new American wife. When Butterfly learns the truth she kills herself.
2001 Neil Humphreys Notes from an Even Smaller Island 213 Like vampires, the ang moh crowd comes out at night, dressed in their best shirts and armed with plenty of tax-free Singapore dollars to woo those local darlings tragically struck down by the Pinkerton syndrome. Like the character in Madame Butterfly, they are somehow lured by the attraction of drunken voices and the possibility of a fat wallet.  2001 Ravi Veloo Radio Singapore International Archive, 2 March. Latino rhythm has taken a whole new generation of Singaporeans by storm .. Today’s generation lacks a sense of discovery, and is simply led by the nose, by whatever is popular in the West. .. There is a popular Indian pub in Singapore that draws only Indians for the music. .. [T]his pub, which alternates between Indian music and the latest cool R&B American hits will never have even a fraction of the attention of the Latino pubs opening all over the place. Ironically, even Latin music can have a Pinkerton Syndrome.  2003 Ian De Cotta Today, 12 December, 39 Not too long ago, another Singaporean wrote that sarong party girls, better known as ‘SPGs’, who crave white men of any shape, size or intellect, are different from the educated Singapore woman, such as herself, whose penchant for ang moh men is restricted only to those who admire women for their ‘brains’ .. What balderdash! Both types of women fall into the classical definition of an SPG, which is an Asian woman who is hopelessly infatuated with white men only. And whichever way you turn the coin, both are SPGs who suffer from the Pinkerton Syndrome.  2004 Eileen Yu ZDNet Asia, 16 December. In a bid to inject new skills into the market and beef up its workforce, the Singapore government encouraged local companies to hire foreign workers. The move sparked off a heated debate in the country, with some arguing that it would feed the Pinkerton Syndrome and encourage organizations to drop local workers in favor of foreigners. The government then stressed the need for companies to keep their focus on merit.",,,

[Mand. 清明节 Qīngmíng Jié Pure Brightness Festival: Qīngmíng Pure Brightness, the fifth of the 24 Chinese solar terms < qīng clear, pure + míng bright, brilliant, light; clear, distinct + jié festival] Also ellipt. Qing Ming; Ching Ming Festival, ellipt. Ching Ming.  A Chinese festival held on the first day of the fifth solar term of the Chinese year, around the end of the second lunar month or the beginning of the third lunar month (in the Gregorian calendar, on 4 April in leap years or 5 or 6 April in other years), the 104th day after the Winter Solstice Festival [Mand. 冬至 Dōngzhì Extreme Winter: dōng winter + zhì extremely, most] which falls on 21 or 22 December, or the 15th day after the Spring Equinox; the festival marks the transition from spring to summer. During the festival the graves of ancestors are visited and tended to [in Mand. 扫墓 sǎomù sweep a grave; fig. pay respects to a dead person at his tomb: sǎo sweep, clear away + mù grave, tomb, mausoleum] and respects are paid to deceased ancestors through rituals such as the offering of flowers, food and joss-paper; the burning of joss-sticks and Hell Money, etc.
¶ The festival is said to have originated from the Cold Food Festival [Mand. 寒食节 Hánshí Jié: Hán cold + shí meal, food + Jié festival], previously kept on the day before the Qing Ming Festival. According to Chinese legend, the festival was held in memory of Jie Zitui who lived during the Spring and Autumn Period (春秋时代 Chūnqiū Shídài) (722–481 b.c.). Ji Zhong’er (697–618 b.c.), the eldest son of Duke Xian of the Jin State [Mand. 晋国 Jìn Guó], was falsely accused of rebellion by one of the Duke’s concubines because she wanted her own son to be crown prince. Zitui, a loyal retainer of Zhong’er, smuggled him out of Jin by night. As Zhong’er had always shown concern for his people’s welfare, Zitui did his best to care for the prince during exile, to the extent of cutting flesh from his leg and cooking it for Zhong’er when they were on the verge of starvation. He did so in the hope that when Zhong’er returned to Jin he would be a benevolent and dutiful ruler. After the death of the concubine, soldiers were sent to look for Zhong’er and escort him home. Entering his carriage, Zhong’er saw an official packing an old mat on to a horse. Laughing, he said, “What on earth is the use of that? Throw it away!” Zitui heard this and concluded that the prince would share only hardship with him but not prosperity. He therefore went into the mountains to live with his elderly mother in seclusion. When Zhong’er finally became Duke Wen of Jin, he rewarded those who had assisted him during his exile but forgot what Zitui had done for him. Upon being reminded, he immediately sent for Zitui but he did not come. Plagued by guilt, Duke Wen and his ministers tried in vain to find Zitui in the mountains; he then ordered the mountain forests set on fire, believing that Zitui, as a filial son, would surely flee the blaze with his mother. After the fire had burned for three days and three nights, Zitui and his mother were found dead under a willow tree, with a note written in blood by Zitui to Duke Wen: “I cut off my flesh as a dedication to wish that you, my king, will always be clear and bright.” Duke Wen, bitterly regretting his actions and extremely saddened, decreed that the day was to be observed in memory of Zitui as the Cold Food Festival, on which no fire or smoke was permitted and only cold food was to be eaten. During the Qing Dynasty [Mand. 清朝 Qīng Cháo] (1644–1911) observance of the Cold Food Festival merged with that of the Qing Ming Festival.

The versions that most Singaporeans are familiar with, however, are slightly different from what one finds in India today as the recipes evolved separately over the centuries.

It is spoken of in the Malay annals as Tamsak. This is the name of an island, which, with the exception of a single village of poor and predatory Malay fishermen, and that only formed in 1811, was covered with a primeval forest down to the 6th day of February, 1819, and is now the first in rank of the European emporia of the Far East. Barros gives a whimsical etymology of the name: “Anciently,” says he, “the most celebrated city which existed in the land of Malacca, was called Cingapura, which, in the language of the country, signifies ‘false delay’ (false demora).” This derivation must have come through the Malays, who, no doubt, were then, as they now are, ignorant of the true meaning of the name.  1955 R.J.

Lately, study mamas have been stereotyped to be indecent and frivolous. In my opinion, it is this ‘built-in’ categorisation of study mamas that has not only cost them their shot at a better life, but has also resulted in Singapore losing prominence as an open and cosmopolitan society. .. It is undeniable that some study mamas are desperate for a source of income and are willing to sacrifice their pride to take on a degrading job. However, their presence should not be an excuse for us to equate study mamas with massage parlour girls or worse, prostitutes. We should not, and cannot, scrap them from our country. .. Perhaps we have not given serious thought to why some study mamas are willing to participate in such activities and so subject themselves to thoughtless criticism. Many schools in Singapore go all out to attract foreign talent to come and study. In many of these situations, worried parents decide to give up their lives back home, opting to accompany their child to a foreign land in the hope of securing a better future for them.

The father of 44-year-old Mohd Iqbal is said to have invented sup tulang – mutton bone with marrow stewed in an explosive sauce of chillies, tomatoes and mutton stock – in the early 1950s. In those days, his father threw in a free mutton bone with every order of mee kuah (spicy noodles). Slowly, customers started asking for only the mutton bone – and the dish was born. This Indian-Muslim stall stands out from other tulang vendors for serving big bones packed with marrow and meat.  2006 Anthony Bourdain New York Times Magazine (from Travel.nytimes.com), 24 September. Since I have a passionate devotion to bone marrow, my next culinary destination was a foregone conclusion. .. Seetoh’s guide pointed me to Haji Kadir-M.

For lunch, I found myself clumsily manhandling a sticky, slippery yet utterly wonderful heap of sauce-dripping bones, all the while wishing I’d wrapped myself in a dropcloth. The red mutton bones, stewed in a spicy sweet chili, tomato and mutton stock, arrived with a useless fork, a spoon, a little cabbage and some fried bread slices to mop up the sauce. The idea, apparently, was to pick up the bones with your fingers and tap them repeatedly until the buttery marrow slid out. Naturally, this didn’t happen. I tapped and banged in vain. I gnawed on the shreds of exterior meat. I dropped my bones, splattering myself, finally settling on spooning a little soup forlornly into my mouth. The proprietors, taking pity on the ang moh (foreigner – literally, “red head”), presented me with a straw, to the amusement of my fellow patrons.

We would throw the balls – some mixed with pink food colouring – into a pot of boiling water and wait eagerly for them to float once they were cooked. The best part, of course, was eating the balls soaked in a hot brown syrup that had been boiled with a few slices of old ginger and pandan leaves. The sweetness of the syrup lifted the simple tang yuan. Traditionally, Dong Zhi, which coincides with the winter solstice and falls on Dec 22 every year, is the time Chinese families gather to celebrate the past year. Tang yuan is eaten to signify unity and harmony within the family. Tang, meaning soup, sounds like tuan, which means reunion, while yuan, which means round, signifies yuan man, or complete. Hence, tang yuan symbolises tuan yuan (family reunion). Not many people I know mark this thanksgiving festival of the Chinese calendar these days, much less make the tang yuan themselves. The balls are now available in supermarkets and hawker centres and are eaten all year round. They come with all kinds of filling – groundnut, red bean paste, lotus seed paste, black sesame and yam paste. They can also be served in peanut soup instead of syrup.  2006 Teo Pau Lin (quoting Benjamin Seck) The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 31 December, L28 Favourite hawker stall? / The tang yuan (glutinous rice balls) stall in Block 85 Bedok North Street 4, and Lei Garden in Chijmes.

1931 L. Elizabeth Lewis National Geographic Magazine, April, vol. LIX, 517–522 To the Hindu god Subramanya, son of Siva, the Tai Pusam vows are made. This three-day ceremony takes place in Singapore in January. Weeks in advance the participants prepare themselves by abstaining from the routines of life. The first day of the ceremony the silver car, which is the palanquin of the image of the god, is brought forth from its shelter in the courtyard of the Tank Road Temple, dusted and polished, then drawn to the South Bridge Road Temple, where it remains under a canopy until the third day. .. On the second day the difficult part of the vow is performed. .. Before me sat a Tamil clad in a loincloth and silver pins. Two temple officials, one on each side, were preparing the martyr for his three-mile pilgrimage to the temple on Tank Road by thrusting pins into his flesh. His chest, his back, his forehead, his arms and thighs, were entirely covered with small, shining, V-shaped pins. He seemed almost in a state of coma and his eyes rolled in their sockets until at times only the whites were visible. .. I found myself in the midst of another group, watching the priests thrusting long spearlike needles through holes in the metal laths of a fanlike arch over another devotee. These needles, which were from two to three feet long, had to be fastened securely in the flesh of the chest and back in order to hold in place this heavy metal canopy. Through his cheek had been thrust a silver skewer, which protruded an inch or more on each side of his face. .. When the route has been traversed and the goal has been reached, the devotee kneels before the image of Subramanya while the friends place on the altar appropriate offerings and the priest bestows his blessings upon the gift and the giver. Then the devotee is taken to a corner of the temple, where the needles, spears, or hooks, as the case may be, are removed. After thus fulfilling his vow he proceeds on his way, apparently none the worse for the ordeal, no trace of blood appearing at any time during the procedure.  2001 Sharmilpal Kaur The Straits Times, 8 February, H3 Thaipusam, which falls on a full-moon day in the Tamil month of Thai, has been celebrated in Singapore for over 150 years.  2005 The Straits Times, 26 January, H4 Balancing milk pots on their heads, devotees set off from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road on a 4km walk to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple in Tank Road.

2000 Kenneth Lim The Straits Times (Life! This Weekend), 28 December, 10 The void deck, with its pillars of resourcefulness, hard work and patriotism, supports our homes and our lives faithfully.  2001 Neil Humphreys Notes from an Even Smaller Island 109 Just a few weeks ago, a bunch of lower secondary schoolboys were kicking a ball around the void deck of my block. Now this is against the law and signs are plastered all around the void decks clearly stating that all ball games are prohibited. After all, these and other young lads could chip the paint, dirty the walls and cause considerable noise pollution for the residents living above. So being an upstanding young fellow of the HDB community, what did I do? I asked to join in, of course.  2004 The Straits Times (Very! Singapore), 9 August, 23 Void decks, the cavernous empty space below blocks of flats, aren’t really, well, void. .. There are now about 7,000 void decks around the island. The oldest is at Block 26, Jalan Klinik, which was built in 1963. This void deck in Tiong Bahru was the precursor to a decision – formalised in 1969 – to keep the first storey of HDB [Housing and Development Board] blocks free. .. Void decks, says the Housing Board, are part of its efforts to provide ‘a sense of relief’ in the densely built city, and a space for interaction and community bonding. But who was the first to coin the now-household term? It appeared in the local papers as early as the 1970s, but no one, it appears, wants to claim credit.  2004 Asad Latif The Straits Times (Very! Singapore), 9 August, 23 Void decks are one of the most public of spaces in the private existence that envelop public housing. They cannot but be public, since they host three essential rituals of life: birth, marriage and death. When a child is born, his introduction to his home takes the form of the lift landing, where his parents wait for lifts unless they live on the lower floors and prefer to walk up.

1638,"[1995 Tan Kim Hock The Straits Times, 3 May, 30 [D]o not propagate the use of wah lau! It is a vulgar expletive! .. Wah lau does not mean “My old one” or “my father” as Ms Sharon Lim said in a review on the Clement Chow and Geoff Tan album entitled “Wah lau! Cannot like dat one meh?” in July 1992. .. Ask any true-blue Hokkien or Teochew speaker, and he will tell you the origin of wah lau is an expletive. It was uttered only by the uncouth, crass and vulgar men, never by women, at least not in public.  2002 The Sunday Times 24 November, 26 The Singlish term “wah lau” has travelled beyond Singapore’s shores and this is something people should be proud of, says comedian and film director Jack Neo. The term is a Hokkien exclamation that can mean anything from “Oh my goodness!” to “Wow!” to “Damn!”  2002 Karl Ho The Sunday Times (Life!), 1 December. Is wah lau vulgar or harmless? [title] Mr Kua Soon Khe, 50, the executive secretary of the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan clan association, says that such a crude phrase should not be highlighted because it reinforces the stigma that the Hokkien language is profane and unrefined. Wah lau, Mr Kua adds, is commonly believed to be derived from the cruder wah lan, which can be translated loosely as ‘oh, my penis’. Mr Lim Guan Hock, 56, a board member of the Hokkien Huay Kuan, says that wah lau evolved when wah lan was pronounced slightly differently. It has the same effect as ‘oh, my goodness’. But, depending on the intonation and usage, wah lau, eh can roughly mean ‘my old man’ or ‘my husband’. But Mr Lim says that wah lau does not really mean anything. Dr Phua Kok Khoo, 60, vice-president of the Singapore Teochew Poit It Huay Kuan clan association, thinks there is nothing wrong with wah lau. He says: ‘The Teochew- and Hokkien-speaking Chinese use it as an informal and casual utterance of surprise.’ Dr Phua, who also teaches at the National University of Singapore’s science faculty, adds: ‘It is nothing rude, and is definitely a common phrase used in daily Singaporean life.’ Wah lau is widely believed to have originated in Singapore. Some Chinese nationals, however, tell Sunday Life! that the phrase is also heard in the southern part of Fujian province in China, where Hokkien is the main dialect. Mr Yang Bin, 35, is a chemical engineer from Fuzhou City in Fujian province who moved to Singapore eight years ago. He says: ‘I have heard it before back in China, but it’s used more often here.’ He also feels there is nothing wrong with the term and that it is not lewd. According to Dr Phua, the term was first heard here only 15 to 20 years ago. It has since been adopted by the Singaporean heartlands, especially the younger generation, adds Mr Lim from the Hokkien association. He says: ‘Phrases like wah peh, which means ‘my father’ in Teochew, might be too traditional for youngsters; and wah lan might be too crude to be used in public. So, wah lau falls nicely in between these two.’]",,,

To insist on there being a pun [on wa lan] is to conduct a linguistic witch hunt.  2002 Lim Yew Peng The Straits Times, 28 November. I am very angry with the writer who said the phrase ‘wah lau’ is a vulgar expletive uttered by uncouth, crass or foul-mouthed men! Tell him I utter these words very often to my friends, and even to my children. But I am not the sort of man he described. Anyway, ‘wah lau’ is not vulgar. .. ‘Wah’, as every Teochew or Hokkien will know, is a dialect word meaning ‘me’ or ‘I’. ‘Lau’ means ‘old’ or ‘old man’, if you refer to an old man. ‘Wah lau’ is merely an exclamation, the way English-speaking people use ‘Oh, my God’.

[F]ew food stalls sell the dry version of wonton mee in ketchup these days, which was how it used to be prepared when hawkers sold their food in pushcarts. .. Food consultant K.F. Seetoh, 44, says wonton mee is a traditional Cantonese dish and the authentic version comes in a gravy that is made of good stock, some sesame oil and pork lard oil, sans ketchup. ‘Ketchup wonton mee is unique to Singapore and you can’t find it in Hong Kong or Malaysia.’ Chef Sam Leong, 41, director of kitchens for the Tung Lok group of restaurants, who grew up in Malaysia, agrees. He says: ‘The dry wonton mee in Kuala Lumpur is served in a dark sauce, so I couldn’t accept the ketchup version when I first had it here in 1980.’ Mr Seetoh does not know when ketchup wonton mee came about, although he remembers ‘growing up on it in the early 1970s’. He says ketchup might have been introduced to the dish as a concession for children who do not take well to the chilli sauce that accompanies the noodles. Another theory he suggests is that ketchup was offered as a ‘modern replacement’ to the pickled green chillies that are added to the dish, since both have a sweet and sour flavour. Mr Voo Kai Seng, 40, owner of Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wonton Mee in Old Airport Road, offers another take. He says: ‘My father used to sell wonton mee in Hougang in the 1960s where there were a lot of Teochews.

Tan Parliamentary Debates: Official Report, 17 March, vol. 42, cols. 1076–1077 Another concern of hawkers is the announced policy of the Housing and Development Board and other relevant authorities not to build any more wet markets in new housing estates. Naturally the fear is whether the present wet markets are also going to be phased out. I for one certainly hope not and would like to appeal to the Minister not to do so because there are thousands of hawkers whose livelihood depends on the markets, and there are even more thousands of Singaporeans who are very used to these markets that it would be a shame for these to be phased out.  2003 Sophie Campbell The Daily Telegraph (from Telegraph.co.uk), 5 July.

Hidden between the chaos of Changi Road and Sims Avenue is Jalan Pasar Baru, an otherwise quiet and almost forgotten part of old Singapore. Usually tranquil and unassuming, the 41-year-old estate is famous for the iconic (if very run down) Geylang Serai wet market, also known in some circles as the “Malay emporium of Singapore”. Although Jalan Pasar Baru is a ghost town on most evenings, the area comes alive every Ramadan – the Muslim fasting month. The reason? People of every race and religion come from across the country for the enormous annual Hari Raya Bazaar, which spills from Jalan Pasar Baru to the neighbouring Malay Village and onto the pavements of Haig Road from late afternoon to the early morning. But next February, the Geylang Serai wet market.. will be torn down under the HDB’s Selective Redevelopment Scheme. .. The charm of Jalan Pasar Baru lies in the fact that very little has changed since it was opened on April 17, 1974 by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then the country’s Prime Minister. The concrete floors of Singapore’s only Malay-Muslim marketplace are always wet, and first-time visitors will be assaulted by all kinds of smells, both foul and pleasant. Rain or shine, the area buzzes with activity every morning as loyal visitors and the occasional tourist explore the untidy maze of stalls.  2006 The Straits Times (from Straits Times Interactive), 28 February. Two years after Seletar Market was closed, residents of the nearby Seletar, Fernvale and Anchorvale housing estates will finally get the replacement wet market they asked for.

Prior to year 2000, the term ‘white horse’ was used to identify sons of influential persons to ensure that such enlistees were not given preferential treatment, and that medical classification and vocational assignment are scrupulously fair. Over the years, the public has widely accepted that the NS assignment system is fair and that there is no preferential treatment to anyone. As such, since year 2000, the SAF does not have a “white horse” classification for national servicemen.  2003 Laurel Teo (quoting Warren Lee) The Straits Times, 12 November, H3 I did have ‘white horses’ as friends when I was growing up, and I can testify that they didn’t get an easier time in the army. .. In a way, it’s good that they don’t have ‘white horses’ any more, because on the flip side, you put the young man, labelled thus, under pressure.  2003 Yan Dah Wei The Straits Times, 18 November, 20 The mere existence of this classification would have sounded warning bells to the camp commanders and officers to take extra care of the particular ‘white horse’ soldier. .. My platoon mates and I were at first unaware that there was a ‘white horse’ among us.

He shouted back, ‘National Day Parade your head, you’d better come out of the bathroom so we can go downstairs’.",,,

1693,"yusheng /yee-shəng, jyːˈʃəŋ/ n. [Mand. 鱼 yǘ fish + 生 shēng raw] Also yu sheng.  A Chinese dish traditionally eaten on the seventh day of the Chinese New Year season consisting of slices of raw fish, shredded vegetables such as carrots, ginger and turnips, deep-fried pieces of flour, a sweet-sour sauce, etc., which is tossed with chopsticks with cries of ‘Lo Hei’.
¶ The dish is eaten at Chinese New Year because the Mand. word for fish, 鱼 yǘ, is a homophone for the word for abundance, 余 yǘ.
2001 Raelene Tan The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 14 January, P12 The seventh day of the first lunar month is celebrated as “Everybody’s Birthday”, or ren ri. This is when the ritual of tossing and eating yu sheng, or raw fish, is carried out with much fun and gusto among Teochews and the Cantonese. “Yu”, the Cantonese word for fish, sounds similar to the word abundance. “Sheng” sounds similar to “life”. .. To the happy cries of “lo hei!”, meaning to “raise up wealth” in Cantonese, the ingredients are tossed and mixed.  2001 “Yusheng Treat for Senior Citizens” The Sunday Times, 4 February, 29 Invited 420 elderly people.. to a yusheng or raw fish salad lunch at the Neptune Theatre restaurant.  2002 Wong Ah Yoke The Sunday Times (Sunday Plus), 4 February, P6 Yu sheng – the popular raw fish salad that is a must in any Chinese New Year menu.  2003 Solomon Lim The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 18 January, L37 While yu sheng was created in Singapore in the 1960s, the origin of this Chinese New Year (CNY) delicacy can be traced back to a simple village practice held by Chinese fishermen in the past. It was traditional for fishermen along the coast of Guangzhou to celebrate the seventh day of CNY, or ren ri, by feasting on their catch as fish, or yu, is synonymous with abundance and prosperity. This cultural practice was then brought to Singapore by migrants where it evolved into fish porridge found at roadside stalls. It was only in the mid-1960s that master chefs Hooi Kok Wai, Lau Yoke Pui, Sin Leong and Than Mui Kai decided to create a unique CNY dish using the strips of raw fish from the porridge. Combining the raw slices of a local fish with a melange of ingredients including shredded carrots, turnips, ginger and jellyfish, yu sheng was intended to be colourful, tasty and, above all, symbolically auspicious for the allegorically-minded Chinese.  2006 Leong Phei Phei The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 8 January, L23 Yu sheng, a traditional Chinese New Year dish that is usually eaten on the seventh day of the Chinese New Year, comprises slices of raw fish with other ingredients like shredded carrot, turnip and jellyfish.  2008 Huang Lijie The Sunday Times (LifeStyle), 28 December, 23 Indeed, yusheng has gone from a humble dish eaten by fishermen in Guangzhou, China, to a Chinese New Year delicacy here. Until the 1960s, the simple raw fish salad comprised slices of cucumber, radish and coriander flavoured with vinegar, oil and sugar.",,,
