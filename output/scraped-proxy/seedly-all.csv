Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4d ago,Purchased,"I was kind of hesitant to sign up for circles life at first as I saw many comments online about bad customer service, poor network and all that. But their cny promo was too good to pass up so I thought just try la. After all if it really was that bad, I can just port out again. I am writing this review to tell those naysayers YOU WERE WRONG. Customer service is clearly next level, I dropped them a dm close to 1am enquiring about how to check my upcoming bill and kai instantly replied me. Not a bot, a real person who sent me helpful screenshots to guide me. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"Having been with circles life since 2018, I can safely say they really are one of the better telcos out there. Their customer service is prompt and efficient. I've seen improvements in their network so it shows they really listen! The app is also one of the best I've used in a long time. An incredible experience that everyone should try for themselves."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service] friendly customer service team that replies even late at night, only wish that they have hotline so i can thank them over the phone personally"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Customer service team is courteous and really know their stuff. They helped clarify that I wouldn't be getting a free tablet with my Data Only subscription, which was a bit of a bummer but it makes sense. Still might get a tablet later for my parents. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"I am writing this as i intend to switch to another telco. Reason being Circles network is really poor. I have been with Circles for some time, the benefits are really generous and customer service is prompt and friendly. But network is core when it comes to selecting a quality telco. Probably M1 network has been deteriorating and Circles that leech onto M1 network is implicated. Thus, its users indirectly affected."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Really friendly agents, especially on IG. Kai was easy to talk to and answered all my queries promptly. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,Will never ever recommend this lousy service to anyone!
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,"Porting over my number was super easy. And you can never run out of or worry about data with Circles. Mobile app has really good UI, I never encountered any issues with buying add-ons or checking my bills. Top-notch customer service as well. If you're looking to port over from another telco, I highly recommend circles"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,"As a long time customer and someone who works on the go a lot, circles really does a great job at delivering a powerful and portable product. I also really enjoy their customer service. Even when I'm busy and forget to reply, an agent always comes to follow-up on my case. Highly recommend circles to everyone."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,Great Customer Service and fast Network to stream movies. The User friendly Mobile app makes it easy to navigate the add-ons as well. Highly recommend using Circles ☺️
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4w ago,Purchased,"I was a happy customer with Circle LIfe SIM only prepaid plan for past years with 2 lines. Initially the data was at 50GB and later increased to 100GB per month.  However with NO notice, CIrcle Life suddenly reduced both lines to 20GB in the middle of the subscription month and causing both lines to go dead (as it exceeded 20GB usage). No reason was given. Bills were paid every month.  It was extremely disappointing and NO response from circle life for 3 days (though has been receiving emails daily that they will respond within 24hrs).  Bad experience and totally unprofessional."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 05 Feb 2021,Purchased,"Have been using Circles for years now, and i have nothing bad to say.  Exceptional customer service. I always have so much data, i don't even use my wifi at home anymore! Best thing is you can also use your hotspot when you are working outside as well - super convenient. Marketing is always top notch too."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 04 Feb 2021,Purchased,Will come back and comment on the other features but so far customer service and port in have been fantastic.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 03 Feb 2021,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Amazing customer service, very prompt replies as well. They were able to answer my questions very quickly."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 03 Feb 2021,Purchased,[Customer Service] [Ease of porting]
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 01 Feb 2021,None,"[Customer Service] Before I purchase the Sim + phone package, I reached out to the customer service to ask if it is possible for me to request for a separate earlier Sim card delivery, as I understand that phone delivery will take a while due to stock availability.  After I have paid for the phone, I then followed the instruction to try to request for the earlier delivery, but there was no option to do so. I reached out to the customer service again and now they are telling me that it cannot be done after ""talking to their team"".  I replied to the email with the copied text from the first customer service guy showing that I was promised it can be done, and requested for their assistance for this. This was last Friday evening, till now I am having radio silence from the customer service. So far the customer service experience has been frustrating as there was a lot of back and forth without anything being solved."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 30 Jan 2021,Purchased,"TLDR: lies upon lies by customer service, porting is a terrible experience and I have not been ported yet even. excuses of ASAP / 24h / 24-48h given, not sure if they have a concept of time. I’m utterly baffled at the customer service and how ‘ease of porting’ is promoted by this company. After 4 unsuccessful attempts, I contacted their Customer Service Chat. I contacted 2 agents asking when I will be receiving the call. Both told me they raised it to be ‘ASAP’. 3. lies upon lies provided by their customer service (ASAP, 24h, 48h)"

Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 29 Jan 2021,Purchased,"Personally been using circles. life for years, the network has improved so much that there's no espect that I'll point out this days,"
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 25 Jan 2021,Purchased,Cell service has been great all over Singapore. Have been experiencing fast 4g speed. [Customer Service] Chat was able to answer any questions that i had !
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 22 Jan 2021,Purchased,"[Customer Service] The customer service is amazing! Had an issue with my data and DM-ed Circles.Life on Instagram at 11 pm. Got an instant reply, was thoroughly impressed!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 20 Jan 2021,Purchased,"Their service used to be a lot better when they first started! I even recommended my mum and my friends to join CL. Fast forward 2 to 3 years and their service experience are no longer what it used to be! Their so-called Happiness Experts are slow to respond and are generally unhelpful! When they do respond, they ignore responding to your queries with almost standard replies and the terse, insincerity that lacks the warmth and empathy! Lethargic! I requested them to give my mum (she is 93 years old and is quite smartphone savvy) the same promo they gave me but they said 'no'! They gave her a 3-month unlimited data freebie but I told them that my mum has more than enough data. It took 2 attempts (and almost 2 weeks of clunky email communication) before they finally helped my mum! When you have a problem and need to speak to someone on the phone, you are not likely to succeed! I am a very disappointed user!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 20 Jan 2021,None,"[Billing & Customer Service] The concept of a no contract Combo Plan was really intriguing but the execution and communication of this unorthodox billing method could have been clearer. For example, I don't understand why even as I am paying for my phone via installments the entire amount is blocked off from my credit card? It's identical to having selected the upfront option with the exception that it's deductible every month. This however is a small gripe that I can live with as the agents who assisted me were patient enough to explain the process. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 19 Jan 2021,None,"Generally, the service and network are OK considering the price. I cannot use rate it one star because of one customer support (but still). Still an active customer for a very long time. Changing to 1 star after contacting Customer Support"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 18 Jan 2021,Purchased,"There was some delay with the vouchers but I spoke with one of the agents, Kai via DM and he got me the codes within the night! Really good service and even now months later I am happy with the 50GB I have."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Jan 2021,Purchased,"[Customer Service] If I were to say only one thing about Circles, it would be about their awesome customer service. In the 2+ years I have been with them, I've contacted them with queries about everything from billing to promotions and every single time they've responded promptly with the utmost professionalism I have not seen in other businesses for a long time.  Sure, more can be done for loyal customers as I've been denied access to certain promos specifically for new customers before but I also see that they have launched similar features for their customers. Now I get monthly rewards from their quest update and they recently upgraded my waiver so that I enjoy $18 forever. I think any other telco would be hard pressed to do that since such a move will surely impact their revenue but Circles has always been an unconventional brand that never played by the rules since the very start. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 07 Jan 2021,Purchased,I got the $5 plan for my dad to use and it was a little frustrating at first as I couldn't find the plan on their website. I reached out to customer service for help and they immediately redirected me to the page to sign up. It has been smooth sailing ever since. Number was transferred without an issue and I downloaded the app for him so I can monitor his usage in case he calls his kakis too much. Would be nice if I could manage multiple plans from one phone but otherwise I think their $5 plan works for seniors!
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 06 Jan 2021,Purchased,[Customer Service] I really cannot tahan some of the customer service from other telcos but with circles they managed to solve a billing issue with a full refund in the span of 2 hours. Some other bloody telco 2 hours also cannot get on the phone with them...
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 06 Jan 2021,Purchased,"I dun understand why the network causes me to restart my phone every time it stuck on loading. And worse, when people calls me, unable to get thru. Whats the meaning of this?!! And more worse Circle Life wants our money and service sucks!!!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 04 Jan 2021,Purchased,- Wasn’t receiving any OTP to my old number after successfully porting in. Turns out that I had to make some changes at settings (shoutout to the customer response team for helping me with this!) 
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Dec 2020,None,"The app had a bug and did not allow me to do the online porting. I reached out to the customer service but they kept asking me to do it on the app. Passed me to several different people to try to have it resolved. In the end they agreed to do manual porting, but gave me the wrong form to fill. I highlighted this but they said it’s ok. Then the next day a new person tell me that it’s not ok. I have to fill in a different form. They also changed the registration name on my app. When I asked them to change it back, they say it will disappear once the number has been ported. However it didn’t happen. They whole proce"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 28 Dec 2020,Purchased,[Customer Service] really very bad CS. need to wait for their replies. 
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 26 Dec 2020,Purchased,They're on M1s mobile network which unlike their wifi services is miles better thank God! Been using it for the past week and no complaints so far.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 25 Dec 2020,Purchased,"Worst telco service i have experienced so far. Please stay away. on the 3rd month of subscription, circle life wrongly charged me a small amount and I also experienced a week service disruption. after contacting support many times, they agreed to refund me the wrongly charged amount, and I terminated the service due to the poor experience. I tried to follow up in mid-Dec on the agreed refund, and keep getting replies they are not going to refund me because 1. the charges are already recorded in advance and 2. I have terminated the service so for goodness sake circle life help your customer understand your logic here?? Due to your own fault, you are not refunding leaving customers the wrongly charged amount??"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 23 Dec 2020,Purchased,"I faced poor internet connectivity (at home, not to mention in the MRT tunnel) and poor call quality (multiple call drops and people can’t hear me for the first few seconds I pick up the call), contacted customer service that referred me to their Network Team but it wasn’t helpful at all because their conclusion was “ we were able to check that a nearby serving site is available and no abnormalities were detected”. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 21 Dec 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Didn’t always contact the customer service but when I do, the staff are very much knowledgeable and they will rectify the issue with you fast. To be honest, I just have to key in my personal particulars and that’s it. It was really fast. Porting over to Circles.Life is my best decision ever."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 19 Dec 2020,None,"[Customer Service] The worst customer service ever, even on the chat the person (Rupert) takes way too long to reply, and their billing system is so weird they bill the phone and the data plan separately. Please don't use them (and Singtel), stick to M1 or starhub."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 17 Dec 2020,Purchased,Customer Service are top notch definitely.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Dec 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] they are the best customer service telco in town. Fast, Responsive, Polite, Experienced & very Knowledgeable when handling my issue."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 05 Dec 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] I must admit their customer service is very responsive. However, when I have questions during the port out process, they are not really helpful."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 25 Nov 2020,Purchased,An unfortunate horrible customer service experience at all the stage of the process. I wouldn’t recommend the company to anyone.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 22 Nov 2020,Purchased,"Switched over from M1 because it costs 40% lesser, for even more benefits! The switch saved me $20 every month. However, they will charge $0.05 for any incoming SMS, which is ridiculous to me because I get spam SMSes and/or delivery SMS/MMS quite often. The one thing that stands out is about their super fast customer service. Pretty much the same network and service for even less money!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 14 Nov 2020,Purchased,Got their $0 base plan for my parents. Very thankful to this service as my parents dont use much data. This is a wonderful cost saver plan xD
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 12 Nov 2020,None,"For a Telco that aspires to be a ""breath of fresh air"" to our local Telco scene, it had been an utterly disappointing experience, and this will probably be the end of my relationship with Circles.Life. I had been a customer with Circles.Life for more than a year, and the network coverage had been getting worse for some reason. To end off this terrible experience, I had an erroneous charge to my card because of a problem with the app. Since last week, I had raised this issue and the customer service exe"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,"The customer support is horrible, a lot of niceties worded into their script but they hang up very quick, close your case after some time period of not hearing even though they take even longer to get back. HORRIBLE!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Nov 2020,None,"[Customer Service] Spend money to join waitlist to preorder iPhone 12 pro max is a brain less system I had seen ever. Go and ask the customer service in messenger before the pre order date keep told me just wait for the email which will send to customer when preorder is ready. Wait for 10 minutes from the beginning of the preorder, no emailed have been sent to us. Where is the promised? customer service? Where is the email to show the procedure to pre order who had joined the waitlist? Brianless system. Ask in the messenger for help on 9.08pm but wait until 1am get the first reply? What a good service. Marked up the phone by 100dollar said due to the lack of product have to use this 100 dollar to secure the phone? It’s fine but still have to wait for 1 month? Lmao. Apart from that, what is the purpose to have a join waitlist system? Ask us to paid but those who paid for it cannot get the phone earlier than who didn’t pay the money to join the waitlist? Well done Circles.Life. Bravo. To be proud of your team. Brain less."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Nov 2020,Purchased,"I can see myself leaving CL, especially as price and service offerings becomes more competitive. Felt bad leaving a service that gave me the best CS experience out of all other service providers. But the iPhone 12 waitlist experience and poor signal strength making me miss calls/SMS/internet even when I'm at home is swaying me to other service providers especially when many WFH and requires a reliable way to contact others and be contacted. Albeit it comes with a year worth of phone insurance and $200 bill credit. Probably no one ever needs a phone insurance plan if you have a case and screen protector on and any other defects will be covered by Apple's 1 year warranty. $200 bill credit after the $100 price increment of the iPhone 12 as compared to the Apple store, makes up to $100 worth of bill credit, which is easily offset if you move from CL's $28 base plan to other service provider such as $20 GOMO plan and save $8/mth that has the same base data (40GB if you sign-up during promotion), more call time, SMS and on SingTel's network which has the highest coverage in SG. [Customer Service] Great CS support throughout my 2-3 years with CL. CSO can always give you a code if you felt that you've missed out on a certain ongoing deal that existing customers can't enjoy. They listened to your feedback and improve on their service, this is obvious when you see some of your feedback affected their plan and promotional offerings. Very customizable, easy to use and gives full control to activate/deactivate add-on services in a few taps. There's some fun feature such as daily polls that allows you to win prizes and missions that will increase your data. Some subtle ads that are disguised as exclusive benefits for CL users to enjoy, however, it's not those annoying ""in your face"" ads and it could be useful if you require those services."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 05 Nov 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] pathetic customer service. Booked a iPhone 12 Pro max and got billed for the booking fee and never received a receipt or acknowledgememt. Tried contacting the customer service several times and was informed everytime that the issue was reported to the ""back end team"". But never got a response in spite of raising the issue with chat, email and customer service number. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 30 Oct 2020,Purchased,[Customer Service] Tried to sign up with them for the last 2 weeks and signed up my interest for the iPhone 12. Everything went seamless and they were great in sending me reminders (daily) to pay the waitlist fee (SG$ 50).

Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 02 Oct 2020,Purchased,"I been using Circles.Life , overall there are no issues with speed and network coverage. The best part is that almost everything can be done online and by ourselves - no need to speak to an agent. App works perfectly. I feel proud to be a customer of Circles Life. <3"
Level 7. Grand Master,Updated on 25 Sep 2020,Purchased,No connection issue and their staffs are always professional yet friendly!
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 19 Sep 2020,Purchased,"Indoor coverage is a bit poorer compare to the others. But among the digital telco, Circles.Life is the only one provide VoLTE service, this is their advantage. [Customer Service] Super fast and responsive customer service. I could say their customer service is one of the best among all the telco. They are consistent and easy to reach. They deliver their promise most of the time. Too many information in the app makes the app seems messy. Can we log in the service portal by browser? What I know is cannot. If I were right, it's not so user-friendly. Hopefully the layout in the app could be improved, and hope they can implement a web portal allow us to log in by browser too. I couldn't say they offer the best value since they are other competitors offer even better choices. But they are definitely worth the value with their customer service quality. Personally, I don't like this kind of gimmick since it could lead to ""double standard"" sometime."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Aug 2020,Purchased,"I have been a Circles.Life subscriber since April 2019. I must say that at the beginning, the quality of service by Circles was easily the best in the industry. Unfortunately, there has been an appalling and rapid decline in service standards since then culminating in my current review. I have encountered many issues with Circles, including overcharging, poor network and other issues, but my recent problem with them (as stated below) have convinced me to leave Circles."

Level 6. Master,Updated on 02 Aug 2020,Purchased,"Circles has been the best telco provider I've ever used so far, primarily due to their quick onboarding service and strong digital presence.

Maybe its a one-off issue and suey suey i kena, but I would have expected the staff to have thoroughly checked before saying that the issue wasnt at their end. I honestly do not know what happens behind the scenes since its the Covid period and perhaps its a mess as well for them. But from the customer's side, it really was an unpleasant last experience with them."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 20 Apr 2020,None,I applaud your efforts to become the fasting growing telco in Singapore. This is not easy because you are up against established & wealthy competitors like Singtel. But you did well by having niche promotions to attract new customers.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 16 Apr 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service]  Reviewing here because no one at Circles Life can't be bothered about an ""old"" customer or understand the issues I have raised.  I was one of the earliest customers when they started off, 3 years I believe? They did a good job from being the first mover and great customer service to the ease of use of app (still is the leading one). As of late last year, I noticed that when I was happily paying $30 (including $2 free incoming) monthly which I was happy to do that, but the news of new customers that came onboard was only paying $18 per month for the same package did put me off a fair bit. Guess ""first-movers"" shouldn't be rewarded? I must be fair that from early this year till now, though they gave me a 3 month discount of $10 (when other new customers are on $18 forever?), I have not heard from them after much discussions via email (which proves to be really bad) with customer service officers not understanding myself, or email bots used? The promise was to revert after 3 months, but... maybe because of the COVID-19 situation, they have been quite busy."
Level 6. Master,Updated on 15 Apr 2020,Purchased,"One thing to take note for all circles life user: Unlike other telcos, you will not be able to receive sms automatically when you are overseas. You will need to request from the customer service to be able to receive sms overseas. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2020,Purchased,[Customer Service] -- Worse The worse service I got from any telco by far. If you have no problem when you port over? good for you. But when you run into problems - The service circles provides is just Braindead level. They follow protocol like it is the bible. They do NOT provide any service at all.  Very passive on their part and Unhelpful. All pretentious service.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Apr 2020,Purchased,"Very disappointed with this telco. I received an SMS telling me that my Starhub number would be ported over by midnight of 24 Feb. This still had not happened by 27 Feb. Only after I contacted customer service did they inform me that my number was not able to be ported. In the meantime, they are charging me $38 for  porting, despite the service not being performed. Rubbish telco."

Circles life, however, was exceptional because it has been a while since I am able to reach customer service personnel without waiting/holding on the line for 30-45 mins only to have the personnel telling me something which i could have done on my own. I love it when they adopt the live-chat session as well as the recorded conversation so that neither one can deny whatever that is being said.  TLDR: Singtel-switched-Circles customer who is very satisfied with the flexibility of circles, providing exceptional customer service and giving the freedom to choose back to the customers."

Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 22 Jan 2020,Purchased,"TLDR: I used CirclesLife for about 2 years before switching over to GRID Mobile. The main reason for switching was due to the prices. However, CirclesLife still has much better user experience using the app, although their customer service has dropped significantly since the beginning. Overall 3/5. I believe CirclesLife leases bandwidth from M1, which has fairly comprehensive coverage. I didn't experience any problems with them, even when I went back for reservice in Sungei Gedong. [Customer Service] 2/5 When I first switched from Starhub, CirclesLife's customer service was incredible. Responses from their CSOs on the app's messaging platform was quick, helpful, and extremely efficient. Compared to Starhub's stupid hotline where they put you on hold for an hour, CirclesLife really blew the competition away. We really have to thank CirclesLife for disrupting the uncompetitive telco market with how they re-conceived mobile service provision. Unfortunately, that was 2 years ago. More recently, their customer service has truly been dismal. Conversations with their CSOs on the app would drop halfway and they would suddenly pair you with a new CSO, and you had to explain your problem all over again. This was incredibly frustrating and on one occasion I was dropped and re-paired a total of 11 times before I gave up. I never got my issue resolved.  I was truly turned off by the lousy customer service that dropped tremendously in standard compared to 2 years ago. Coupled with the better value for money in other plans, it was difficult for me not to switch."

Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 24 Nov 2019,Purchased,"Firstly, I had the port-in promo. The porting in process was absolutely seamless. My number was originally not under my own name, so using GOMO or Giga, I had to manually do the number transfer. Moreover, I called Starhub and they said I had to go down to the shop personally with the account holder, pay a $20 transfer. Circles.Life had none of these, they simply had me key in the account holder's IC number, sign, and did the rest for me. Voila. App is clean, super easy to use. Data roaming is cheaper (and makes much more sense) than GOMO. Customer service was insanely good, they even replied my email on a weekend within 2 hours."

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 16 Nov 2019,Purchased,"I have never never in my life think that telecom can be so efficient and responsive assuring that the customer is attended regardless of any plans. Follow up so closely to Ensure that I know what’s going on.

I was so amaze by Circle life technology that really focus on what the current telecom is lacking on! Where you can get the plan just a simple click on their website and they will do everything for you at a speedy delivery! Well done Circle life!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 25 Oct 2019,None,"One of the telco I’ve been using quite sometime , so basically I’m writing this a bad one because I personally experienced it . So at this point of moment where I have 1 outstanding amount which wasn’t paid , so I decided to look for the happiness expert ( customer service) and enquire about is it possible that I made the payment on this date so and so . So they went on did their checking , they said alright sure can . So I did double confirm with them that I will pay on this certain date and my line won’t get cut off right ? , they said no as long as I pay on the date as I promised because it will really affect my school schedule . So Guess what , exactly on that night my line got cut off . So I was extremely pissed about it I went to look for their happiness expert again (customer service) and asked what’s going on , so they said rest assured they will get it back reconnected . Which I have to wait 2 whole days . So alright it’s their first I completely let bygones be bygones. Then when a year after the same thing happened. Exactly the same thing happened. This is the reason why I’m giving this a bad one . To me their only main word will be rest assured and the fact you can rest assured because you’ll be chasing them to reconnect your line like crazy . They don’t simply make a follow up about it . Customer service sucks and billing service sucks . Wouldn’t recommend anyone taking this . "

They are very helpful in answering your questions and doubts. Back then for the Yishun network dead zone, they solve it after you have pinpoint them the exact location that you have found. They will add another repeater in that area. The other time was, during my reservist period. My second phone was still using the whole 2G network under Singtel, before they announced eliminating the network entirely to move towards 3G baseline network. So I asked them if they give another SIM card under the same line, and they said it's possible!  All your mobile plan are controlled inside an app by theirs. So you can mix-and-match anytime to change and suit your needs. Likewise, if you are planning to go JB, just turn on your data roaming on the app. They are activated a few minutes later! No more asking for roaming services via some website and wait for weeks to process. They now have a quiz section, that if you answered by the majority you get extra data as well! Gone the times you have to struggle, and think of how much data limit you have to plan out for this week, just so you have enough for the remaining days. Going green, the monthly bill payment are stored in the app, no more fussy monthly bill posted to you.

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Aug 2019,None,The best telco in Singapore. Service is fast and excellent. All members of my family has switch to Circle.Life
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Aug 2019,None,"Quite a smooth and direct process in application, and the plans are attractive too. Had some difficulties with the bill breakdown and misunderstanding of charges but customer service (chat service) was very prompt to resolve the issue. Service officer was polite and knowledgeable in offering solutions, which then changed my intention from termination to continuing my service with Circles. I had plenty of questions towards the fees and policies but he could explain each part in clear details + examples. So kudos in that, didn't have to get confused further. Hopefully Circles continue to keep up with their quick customer service and valuable plans. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Aug 2019,None,Circles is good because they build a community where people can share (earn data through referrals) and interact (polls and events). They value their customers. One suggestion I would make though is to make the price more appealing as competitors are now offering more with a cheaper price. 
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Aug 2019,None,"Love circles life telco! Honestly is the best, as u can customise all you want in your line. They will always check with you about their services and how to improve them by giving its users surveys. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 17 Aug 2019,None,"I've been with Circles Life since they first came to Singapore. And I've never had an issue with them. Their customer service is not only easily reachable via their chat, they are very helpful and do their best to help you in any way possible. I've recommended them to a number of people who are now paying half of what they used to pay with their previous telcos and are currently enjoying more freedom and benefits with Circles Life's customizable and affordable plans. Looking forward to many more years with Circles Life. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 17 Aug 2019,None,"I was a bit worried initially when I ported over to Circles Life because Circles Life seemed ""cheap"" in comparison to major players like Singtel and Starhub, but the data connectivity and amazing customer service only made me regret why I did not make the switch earlier. - User friendly and easy application process - 24/7 customer service team that is contactable via live chat or email anytime"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 17 Aug 2019,None,"I was initially a little apprehensive as Circles life did not have a physical store. Despite that, their online services were top notch. For instance, I was constantly updated on the delivery status of my SIM card via sms. Even when they were unable to locate my actual address, they tried contacting me. On top of that, their online messaging system was efficient and their staff readily made themselves available in case I needed help. Prices are excellent and reasonable with freebies such as unlimited data dangling from time to time. I also like how instructions were concise and lengthy terms and conditions were minimised. Despite not being tied down to a contract, I think I’d stay with Circleslife  for quite some time."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 17 Aug 2019,None,"The sign up process was fuss-free and immediate. Having received the sim card within days was amazing. No more having to queue extremely long hours just for a new phone/sim card. The signal is also way better than my previous telco, leaving me with no complaints at all. They’re also generous with giveaways and discounts and I see their efforts in engaging with customers which is really commendable in an industry which just asks you to sign up for their plans. Good job Circles! 👍🏼"
Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,"I was an early adopter of $0/mth Flexi-Plan in June 2018. This plan has 1GB data, 30 minutes talktime, 10 SMS, free caller ID. Though no overseas roaming service available. Those who are frequent travellers would need to take note.  Signing up on their website was quite simple. Just create a new Circlelife account with personal particulars, choose $0/mth Flexi Plan, upload my digital copy of NRIC and lastly fill in a Credit Card number. Delivery of SIM card by courier cost $6, there was no self-collection site.  Also, the app has a online Live Chat function with their customer serivce staff when I have an enquiry. The Live Chat does not respond immediately when activated, there will still be some minutes of waiting time before someone respond to my enquiry.  I have already used this Flexi-Plan on my spare phone for more than 12 months and Circlelife is still continuing this $0/mth plan with no changes in plan price yet. According to the Circlelife's customer service staff on livechat, as long I have usage on this line, either data or talktime in the last 3 months, this line will not be suspended or terminated. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 16 Aug 2019,None,Circles life is handsdown the best telco and has great customer service that beats any other telco. No way any other telco can compete with providing pro customer plans as well as prompt customer service
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,Always have free data. Circles apps is user friendly. Ive been using it for almost 2 years. No complaint so far. Now with overseas data is even more awesome. Add ons are easy. 
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,"Circle life is the best telecom that I have ever used, 10/10 customer service, affordable and definitely giving user a great and positive experiences have been with them with years!:)"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,A very attractive mobile and data plan with regular promotion that keep customers attached with surprises
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,"Application was seamless, really impressed with their customer service who answered my queries with clear explanation and excellent interpersonal skills. Really happy with the data bonuses every now and then and that I saved quite a bit as compared to when I was still in binding ""slave contract"" with the previous telco 😉"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 16 Aug 2019,None,Is a great tele company. Especially the customer service team giving a excellent service. They reply fast and polite and trying their best to slove the problem  u facing. 
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,"Circles.Life has an easy application process just by doing it online. It is fuss-free, just taking a few minutes to fill up my particulars, make payment and viola, their staff processes the application within a few days and got back to me on the delivery of my SIM card. They have excellent customer service, even through the Facebook Messenger channel which I prefer since I’m busy working during the office hours and couldn’t really make a call. Even though there was a hiccup with the payment for registration initially causing a double charge to my card, the staff handled it situation well and were quick to process a refund for me and provide me with regular updates for the refund. Amazing telco with the customer in mind!"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 16 Aug 2019,None,all my immediate family are using circles.. it's great. the service and offer are to die for. been using them for almost 6 month and counting.  unlimited data with 300 mins outgoing calls. 🥰
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,The day I buy circle life..worth every penny I pay ..just need bank account and live chat to the circle life..any prob they help ASAP ..I lost my sin card in overseas and chat with them the next following day I get a new SIM card with the same number ..TOP up data easy ..circle life data worth and cheap ..get free data for National Day for 9 days what else we need ..what ever they doing it pleases the customer..kudos to circle life 
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"good customer service, prompt replies and follow up done! connection is good and only 1/3 of my old usual bill! ;-)"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Cheapest in market, with user friendly apps, recommended to heavy user data, even roaming data is cheap, just use in Philippine, $8 per 1GB, which is very affordable..greayly recommended.. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,Service has been great so far. With constant free data plan to loyal exisiting customers :) very convenient to check my data balance/usage via their app as well. Would highly recommend it to people who wants to have the flexibility and control over their own plans with no contract!
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 15 Aug 2019,None,"super helpful customer service!! That was superb only thing was that new customers seemed to be getting better deals etc.. which felt bad, but then again we would get more data and freebies etc... (for me it was about price, as never manage to fulfil data caps) "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,circles is reasonably reliable and offers competitive pricing for its services. the one downside is that there is no hotline to call when you feel like screaming at someone. great way to train your capacity for patience. 8/10.
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"I signed on with Circles 2 years back and I have been very pleased with their services since and it is definitely value for money for the amount of data I get. The app's UX/UI design is great, love it!  I also love that there are options to boost your data by their partnership programs such as linking your EZLINK to the app. Something I recommend to my friends looking to switch telcos. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Initially, when Circles came into the market, I was rather skeptical. I was on M1 then, and was rather pleased with their services compared to the other 2 Telcos stated. Didn't think or moving over to them at the time, that's until my workplace sent out an email stating that they have a CIS package.  After a month using their services, I was pretty much sold to them. Their online chat made it easy to seek clarifications and doubts, and their turnaround time is way better than the 3 other Telcos. I have had to wait for more than 15 mins the least before I manage to get someone on the line,  and that is before I have to go through the frustrating process of listening to the teleprompter. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Overall experience is good, service replies are quick if you have any questions/doubts "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Great affordable fuss free sim only plan. Great customer support as well, the interface is user - friendly as well. Truly a remarkable feat"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Circles.Life has brought value to us customers as the previous telcos like singtel, StarHub & m1 overlooked. Circles.Life was the genesis of a telco that required no contracts. It allowed us consumers to “decide” the amount of data we consume. They come up with Creative ideas on how to retain us customers by issuing loyal customers extra data’s for the month. Which is a we win situation as data in the current era is considered a necessity for us millennials we consume tons of data. They are thoughtful as they came up with plans that provide consumers “unlimited data” at a price of $20 which is really valued as the anchor was over a $100 ~ $200 per month for the other telcos. Personally I for one would recommend anyone in my social circle to use it. As it really brings allot of value to consumers. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,Customer service is fast. They helped me when i had problem logging in into my account.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Customer Service is literally the best, not only in the Telco area, but also throughout my life experiences with CS. Your questions were promptly answered, things are solved almost always within 3 working days, at most 1 week."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,Is very fast and does not deduct ur data on.whatsapp nice service and really affordable.So if you are on.a budget this.is a plan.to look for
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Nice customer service, application process is smooth. It’s so helpful for people who wants to cut down their expenses because they have verygood offer for data plans "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Very good customer support on Facebook !  But only issues . No mailing / Cash Monthly Payments services and very poor underground service signals .  But other than that , service are quick and not an issues . Cheaper Plands can still be introduced ! "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,"Best online mobile service provider, I say. Strong connection, comprehensive plans, unlimited data. All at value for money prices. What more can you ask for? "
Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,2) wonderful customer service;
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,It is a great service provider. I get sufficient data with no lagging. The staff are also very nice and helpful when I asks questions when applying for the line. 
Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"First entity to disrupt the telco market! Live chat, good customer service, awesome fb group for insiders makes me stay, Although new mnvos and telco offerings has become more competitive and lower priced than Circles Life, will still stay with circles for sometime because circles once liberated me from choosing between 3 slow ineffective traditional telcos that are more monopolistic than competitive."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Customer Service: Contacted customer service via Facebook messenger with some queries when I'm not sure about some stuff. Reply is almost immediate if not just a short wait. The staff replying is also friendly.
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"I don't look much in a Telco. As long as they give me what they promise and don't overcharge me, I'm more than happy. But not only had Circles Life met that standard, they top it off by having amazing customer service and community management team. And that's a rarity in Telcos that sets Circles apart from the rest"
Level 6. Master,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Signed up for the $0 Flexi Plan. Only grouse is that they bill their data in 1 min block ""Local voice services are chargeable on a one (1) minute pulse basis for the first minute"", which meant that if you took 30 calls in which you only said ""hello"", that would be 30 mins of talktime."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Circles.Life is my favourite service provider so far! Mobile plans offered are flexible and non-binding. One point that everyone loves is the never-ending treats of free data during festivals and birthdays. 
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"What got me not so happy lately with Circles Life, was in the bid to compete with Singtel GOMO (most similar competition), they started a promo for new sign-ups. But did not give loyal existing customers the same benefit. I continued to pay $10 additional per month compared to new sign-ups. This is $120 additional per year - not an insignificant amount to me. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"I was stuck with ""one of Singapore's main telcos"" for many years with overpriced phone plans that were inflexible, with poor customer service to boot.

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Also their customer service is the best since you can contact then anytime and anywhere! Looking forward to more years with circles life!
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Circles never fail to surprise its customer with great deals like free data and events. It has a strong customer support team that is always ready to help its customer. One thing i like about its after sales service is that i do not need to call a number and listen to an automated voice asking me to press lots of number and still have to wait for 10-20 mins before a customer service officer picks up. I strongly recommend people to give circles a try.
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"The service of the staff is really phenomenal. They are so efficient and patient.  All in all, I really love the service that they provide, the flexibility you have in your own phone plans (add-ons). "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Going on my 3rd year on Circles.Life, everything smooth, and always got fast response from the customer service when I have a question. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Signed up with Circles back when they were offering 3GB + bonus 2GB. Now they automatically upgrade everyone to 20GB. Besides that they continuously look at ways to reward their customers & constantly innovate, so much so the big 3 have to copy them in putting customers first instead of profits."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Circle Life has been a fuss-free telco. Prompt with responsive service. It is also value for money. Best is that there is no contract which gives us consumer the flexibility to change to another telco anytime.
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Very friendly customer service as well, answering all my enquiries so far."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Customer Service: 4.5/5  I actually had a problem with this when I was in Indonesia a few months back, where they didn't activate the Boost I bought, a few text to customer service on their app and my refund was done almost immediately. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Always great, no regrets for switching telco 3+ years back! Thanks for the constant engagement with customers like myself; the voting, giveaways, content creation etc! Cant wait to watch Circles expand and grow huge!"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Switching Telcos: Truly excellent, seamless service to switch over (from Singtel). Pick up of the SIM card was super easy from my nearest post office (but you can get it mailed as well)"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,The customer service team is also awesome. I have encountered a few issues with billing a
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Of the most seamless and easy telco in terms of signing up. One can get going in less than 15 minutes - a fantastic feat compared to the long waiting times of the traditional players. As the networks rides on M1’s infrastructure - reliability and speed isn’t an issue. As for customer service, the mobile app covers most of the bases, and personally, this is a major plus point for me. In this day and age where time is a premium, finding the time to visit a telco outlet is almost impossible. And this is where Circles.Life have done well by bringing the customer service to their customers instead of the traditional model, and saving them operating  costs on which they pass the savings to their customers in the form of generous data allocations. I’m happy with Circles.Life and for those who have their hesitations, I’d recommend them to try the $0 plan to see what a spectacular ride they’re in for with Circles.Life! "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"What truly sets them apart, however, is its customer service. Nowhere else (and I have subscribed to almost all, if not all, of the providers) have I experienced better customer service, in terms of friendliness, helpfulness, promptness and transparency. In fact, this is t"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Love the plans that they offer, after I signed up with them, I never had to worry about Data. What I like most about Circles.Life is that they are more than just a telco, all the surprises they have and all that little details they do for customers. Really recommend them."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,I actually applied through a roadshow instead of the usual online application. The process from start to finish took only about 10 minutes and the employee handling the sign up process was friendly and helped me fill in everything and handed me the sim card after everything was done
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"A lot of people look at the price/value proposition of the service and concluded that it is not as good as the other providers. True. They are a MVNO, using another telco's network to provide the service but that's where things started to be different.  They have at least taken care of the current customers a bit more than the competition.  Do understand that not all services will be perfect. There are spotty connections in some odd places in Singapore. The best part is that there is no contract to tie you down so you can change to another service provider should the connection be bad. To me the best customer service is the one that allows you to leave if they are not up to your standard. For that Circles.Life gets full points from me."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Their customer support is also very responsive, answering my queries and worries in a timely and kind manner. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 14 Aug 2019,None,Next customer service ever unlike other telco sometimes Circles.Life will surprise customer with reward and stuff
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Very user friendly app user interface. Data management is a breeze as one is able to tailor the amount of data purchased according to their monthly consumption, thus not forced to pay exorbitant prices. I would highly recommend Circles Life to everyone out there "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"What else can u ask for, free data for answering poll. No need exercise. And circles have constantly be in the forefront of coming out ideas to give to the customers!!!!!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 14 Aug 2019,None,"The Circles.Life app that is used to manage our plan is really user-friendly and easy to navigate around. The customer service replies to help/queries in-app almost immediately. Moreover, they provide existing customers with benefits along the way which is really good, like unlimited data on National Day! WOWWW!!"
Level 7. Grand Master,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"My experience with Circle Life has been positive ever since i port over from Starhub. From the porting in experience to using it for close to 9 months now, everything is fuss free. I am notified when the bill is in and the customer service has been good, if not great. Highly recommended for people who feels that the top 3 carriers are charging too high."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Aug 2019,None,"Lousy teleco, only focuses on profit, flashes promotion to lure in customers and neglect existing loyal customers. Avoid at all cost. Bad service staff, gives attitude when contacted"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 09 Jul 2019,None,"When I contacted circle CS via messenger, the staff mentioned that I need to check with SingTel myself despite promising hassle free transaction. Overall, did not receive satisfactory service with inadequate responses to my enquiries."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 01 Jul 2019,None,The customer service team is always very helpful. I am always very happy as I know my issues will be resolve promptly.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 01 Jul 2019,None,"To be honest, the best thing isn't that their data plans are damn worth it, its their customer service. No more listening to a robot and waiting for someone on the other side to pick up, its now a chat room. The longest I've waited for someone to answer my query was 5 mins, usually its almost instant! Very helpful because you're not texting a robot but an actual person."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 01 Jul 2019,None,Almost 2 years with circles.life and I have thoroughly enjoyed their service. Their customer service will respond to you as quickly as they could. Connections are pretty good apart from underground in mrt stations. 
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 01 Jul 2019,None,"Circles life provided great 24/7 online customer service. Their mobile connection is also really great, as I do not experience any drops when using it. Not to mention, they are super cheap and give a lot of data for the amount of $$$ you pay!"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 01 Jul 2019,None,Did not encounter any service disruption so far since I joined at the start of the year. Customer service was also top notched - I raised an enquiry when my cash back was not given and they replied promptly to inform that they will rectify it in the next month bill (and threw in free 1 GB of data that month too :D )
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 26 Jun 2019,None,"Porting over was so easy. First time I got same day sim delivery. Never thought it was possible to get so much data, they are truly game changers. My parents whom were already on circles life got upgraded from 6gb to 20gb. They won't leave existing customers behind! Got a reply via their help chat in minutes. Good customer support."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 26 Jun 2019,None,"No fuss on the number porting, hardly any service disruption. Just switch your phone SIM on midnight of the next business day."

How come like that? i request your staff to call me back but did not receive any call back from them until now….."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Jun 2019,None,Love how prompt & friendly their customer service folks are 👍🏻
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 13 Jun 2019,None,"Circles.Life offers great plans! Using their 1 GB $0 flat plan and it was absolutely fuss free.  Used their plan to hop over from my legacy Singtel plan and they took care of everything. Even when i was using my dads line, he just had to sign his signature on the app to transfer ownership and provide his NRIC. No need to go down to the service centre! Yesssss. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 01 May 2019,None,I had a defective SIM card that took 5 interactions to resolve to reach a conclusions - and insult me as a client by giving a '$25 waiver' which they charge for a replacement card - for their bad service and defective products.  Their people are poorly trained and not empowered to resolve problems. They hide behind process.  
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 25 Apr 2019,None,"I was always feeling angry to be paying top dollar to my then telco but monitoring my data consumption like a scrouge. Coupled with the fact that I was with the same telco since I started working a long time ago and always felt left out in ongoing promos. Then I switched to Circles and never looked back. Granted I had a bump when my SIM card didn't arrive at first but all fears that I had no customer service because there was no physical shop were unfounded as they gave the most prompt and efficient service that i had in a long time. Since then, I have converted my entire family to Circles. Just waiting for their solution re overseas plan to make it perfect!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Apr 2019,None,Porting was easy and fuss free.  Many different types of perks given to loyal customers. But customer service experience wasn't ideal over the phone.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Apr 2019,None,Customer service wise they are quite prompt on Facebook answered my enquiries pretty fast. Overall quite a good operator.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Apr 2019,None,"Porting over was easy and fuss-free. Really great perks when they just started. But now, as they are gaining market share, the customer service has been getting worse. I was enquiring on whatsapp passport when I received the mailer on it being stopped. Customer service advised that it can be activated thru them but few months later when I want to activate, they now say it has been stopped completely. And the attitude from them wasn't helping at all. Now I am thinking to change the telco that provides overseas data packages not on roaming."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 23 Apr 2019,None,"The overall process from Sign up, to delivery of SIM card, to porting in of number, to customer support is a breeze! And i can even customize my plan as and when i need?! SAY WHUTTTTT! The competitive pricing and not being tied down to a long a** contract makes me love it so much! WHAT A DEAL, WHAT A STEAL!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 17 Apr 2019,None,"Used it for 2 years, then decided to port over to Singtel as singtel had more competitive rates. Good whilst it lasted, but when porting, they didn't cancel my account and continued to charge sgd 28 every month for 2 months, although the overseas-based email customer service have said they terminated my line. Still waiting for the refund to happen (been 2 mths) and hoping they don't charge me a 3rd month. Avoid."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 12 Apr 2019,None,No customer service representative to solve issue...using machine as customer service is terrible service provider...old ppl cannot read instructions can't hold lines with this service provider. . .
Level 5. Genius,Updated on 06 Mar 2019,None,"Good deals with more data over the months. Responsive customer service. Somehow after I left for another telco, I could no longer signed up for their new plans. Seems like a ban or blacklist."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 04 Mar 2019,None,"After activation of the sim I realised I made a huge mistake. I had to chase them to honor what I had signed up for , also i spent more time with then on chat then I would do a normal Telco. After a day I wanted to cancel they said I can't as I should have read terms and conditions that locked in to 2 billing cycles hence a 2 month contract when they advertise it to be no contract. The service is lousy, the app often crashes and it's just constantly advertising to to upsell.  Awful and big regret . Don't get sucked into their false advertising."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 23 Jan 2019,None,"APPLICATION PROCESS I’d applied for the line on Monday late afternoon and I get my SIM card delivered the next working day at my workplace. The application process was really enjoyable and simple. It’s a breeze as I just need my phone and my bank card ready. The online chat assistant were very active and friendly for my enquries too. CONNECTION IN MRT I travelled the Purple NEL and Yellow Circleline daily, no experience of connection drop when I surf, Facebook, Instagram and watch snaps of video on those platforms while on train. Calls received were clear and no breaks too. Signals on land are pretty strong too. PRICE I'd ported in from other telco, I get an additional 2GB/month free. Total of 6GB in total only $28/month and this is without any tied down of any contract. Many other telco are starting or started to offer SIM-ONLY plans, but my personal reason to remain with Circle is because they offer 500MB/month for every 6 months you stay with them. It is a definite benefits with practicality for being a loyal customer! After two years, you get 2GB more on TOP of your 6GB at the price of $28! "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 10 Jan 2019,None,- Very very very good customer support. Speedy reply and very patient and understand. 
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Jan 2019,None,"Circles Life has good customer service and rewards their customers for their loyalty. When I contacted them about being charged for an MMS that I did not send, the Customer Care agent agreed to waive the charge right there and then - no question asked or waiting a few days to know the outcome. They also reward their customers with 500 MB bonus data for every 6 months that you stay with them. In addition, they have been giving bonus data through daily polls and on special occasions."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 29 Dec 2018,None,Good service and customer service response. Good value of money  and so far the service still never fails me.  over all great plan and service.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 31 Oct 2018,None,"Initially had a lot of issues with connectivity/stability with 4G. Customer service although painful, was still a whole lot better as compared to other mobile carriers'."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 11 Oct 2018,None,2 years on Circles.Life and their Customer Support and Marketing folks are awesome. Hear us rant and give us data with surprises.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 11 Oct 2018,None,"Circles life offering best plan to the customers, they allowing customer to change their data plan according to their monthly needs monthly. Again, it’s not one month or two months, it is every month!  Circles life partnering with a lot of company throughout the years, and resulting in a lot of different interesting promotion to customers. SOme examples are EZ-Link, SP Power and etc. "
Level 5. Genius,Updated on 18 Sep 2018,None,"Honestly it has good customer service, decent internet speed (from M1) although there are numerous other cheaper alternatives for unlimited data elseway for cheaper prices! "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Sep 2018,None,"So I think they were confused on how to get me the simcard, he asked me to text my house address and maybe they will send it to me personally. Also asked me what time will I be at home. But now that I think about it, why would they ask me for my house address?? They should have all those details which I provided when I signed up on their website right?? Suspicious. Then I went to their website to Live Chat with someone at Circles Life. Ok I must say there was a person on the other side chatting to me and she was quite professional in the way she answered my question etc. She managed to waive the SGD15 charge because not my fault that this happened. 11 September - Got a call Circles Life late evening around 7PM asking me to confirm my IC number and date of issue. I happened to be in the middle of something that I didn't have wallet with me. But really? Shouldn't they already have such information??? I said to the person I am in the middle of something now I don't have the Issue Date of my IC. He said this is really urgent he's at the warehouse and needs these details to send the package out. I said I don't have the Issue Date, but I can give him my IC number la...he said ok. So gave him my IC number. All in all, I will save around SGD40 in my phone bill with Circles Life as compared to Starhub with alot more data, but perhaps the above problems shouldn't have happened as they have been around for some time now. Furthermore they shouldn't be asking for all this personal data when they should have all this in the first place right?"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 06 Aug 2018,None,the service is pretty good. easy ways to self help and self service so I don't have to spend time to go through their calling system. 
Level 6. Master,Updated on 04 Aug 2018,None,"In itself, Circles.Life is a customer-centric, marketing-focused company.  It leverages on product marketing to differentiate itself, and has been experimenting with various ways to talk to their customers, especially whenever there are inquiries.  I have been a customer since 2016 as an early adopter. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Jun 2018,None,"I must said that me and my wife have been using this circles.life plan for 4months with no hussle at all... Everything is transparent and plus no contracts at all, at any moment we can cancel if we want to without paying any termination fees. Service customer wise, they are indeed very prompt in replying and also in a freindly manner should be on live or make calls but normally thru emails as they will explain to you in a Layman terms for us to understand. The service line as well, its very clear and not to say crystal clear but it's just perfect and me and my wife took the 26GB, even till end of the month, we do still have balance GB as shown on the circles.life apps. So far we never try the whatsapp passport or roaming yet but definately going to use it one day as they will show us per day, per each countries we need to pay. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 10 Jun 2018,None,"Very good and efficient service! In the long term, it helps saves money as well, since i don't have the habit of changing phones every year/every 2 years."
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 31 May 2018,None,The CirclesCare app is user friendly. So far I've only used the data and I'm satisfied with the 
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 26 May 2018,None,"It’s really perfect for me! No more being tied down by contracts, flexible - I can add on more data or even pause the plan if I’m overseas for long periods, I can monitor my phone bill and usage easily on the circles life app. It’s user-friendly and their customer service is prompt & friendly. I recommend this mobile service to everyone! Try it, change your life, be free! "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 18 May 2018,None,Circles.Life provides an accurate billing system.  Easy to manage the customize and data usage.  Good loyalty reward and customer services.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 02 May 2018,None,"Initial contact with before I decided to change to circleslife is their customer service. I signed up for their free trial past year and realize the signal at my residential address is very weak. Although they advertised as 4g island wide coverage, but the signal was only 2-3 bar most of the time. Emailed them to enquire, they replied within 2hrs! Unexpected fast reply which ""wow"" me. They helped with the issue and engaged their network team to investigate. It took about 2weeks to get back to me, but they managed to resolve the weak signal issue. Now, I'm their happy customer! Although I still encounter fluctuating signal at my residential, but it is still acceptable. Highly recommended! Moreover if you need data, they are giving free 500mb/ 6 months perpetually till you decided to end your contract with them."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 27 Apr 2018,None,Switched away only because another service provider fits my need better.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 10 Apr 2018,None,No real issues with Circles Life. But you can't do a transfer of ownership once you are an existing customer.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I've been with Circles.Life for a couple of months, and I'm happy to say that I'm pleased so far. The plan is very affordable for $28, and if you require any add-ons, you can do so with the CirclesCare app. The CirclesCare app is sleek and easy to maneuver around. One of the common complaints of Circles.Life is that its network connection can become weak when your MRT goes underground, however I've not experienced this before. Personally, one of the greatest virtue of Circles.Life is how the company always has the welfare of the public at heart. Not only is it constantly having promotions to attract potential new users to join, it is also coming up with more activities and deals for existing users too. This is something that I really appreciate of Circles.Life."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I've been on Circles for 3 months now and it has been such a refreshing experience. I really love the intuitve layout of the app and how things such as temporary suspension could be done easily. I especially love the reminders they send occassionally on the loyalty bonus, it keeps users like myself excited. But most importantly, cared about. That's why Circles wins my hearts because this is a product that is marketed and created to serve our needs. I'm really happy with all the services but since is a honest review, I shall name some bad too. Connection are bad in underground stations- There was once I lost my connection in the train from Outram to Hougang. It is only when i stepped out of the train, did I had connection. But since I stay in the West and takes the EWL, that was just one small issue. Also, the extra charge during the first month was a little shocking. Especially for me as I got the bill just 3 days after I'm with Circles, I immediately second think if I made a wrong decision haha. But nonethless, all's good, all's good! Circles please continue doing all these great stuff and I'll continue to stay loyal, get my friend onboard to earn those data heehee ❤"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,they have changed the mobile market ever since they have come on board.  Excellent customer service and extremely responsive.  It is good that they are listening and making inroads to win users over.  I am 20 months into circles and have no complaints at all.  Excellent overall connectivity from wherever I am.  
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"Happy to be circles.life customer. * User-friendly website and app, unlike SingTel. Easy to obtain any information immediately."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I was a little sceptical when Circles.Life first came out. More data with cheaper monthly bill? Sounds too good to be true to me. So I waited another year to observe this virtual telco before making the switch from SingTel. Even then, I was nervous about hidden costs, slow data, or poor customer services. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,- Manage your plan through an mobile app instead of calling through their customer support. - No customer support hotline to call
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,"I've been with Circles.Life for just over 2 months and the porting experience was smooth. No long waiting times over the phone/customer service counter. They also replied my many queries really quickly! As a student, even the benefits at the other telcos could not beat the price or data that I could get on Circles.Life. Currently, I'm paying $28 for 7GB/month. (no add-ons)"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Apr 2018,None,Ported my number in last year from M1 and never looked back. Super star service and more GB than I can ever imagine. Highly recommend their service.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,"Last but not least, the customer experience with circles.life has been amazing. I started with 6gb data, then i received an additional 0.5GB data on my bday, and another 2 GB data from a promotion. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,"I've been a customer of Circle.Life for 1 year and 3 months now! Here are some of the things I like and dislike about it: Customer Service: Communication with customer service is done via the Circles.Life app. Generally they have been prompt in responding on the live chat, and from past experience they are so much faster than M1 call center! Customer service officers on the other side of the live chat can troubleshoot and make changes to your account for you (for example, I chatted once to request for them to pause my plan for a few months as I was travelling overseas). One downside might be the lack of a human touch, I do miss speaking to a customer service officer over the phone. Circles.Life live chat hours are: Monday - Friday 9am to 10pm, Weekends & PH 9am to 6pm. Mobile App: Very user friendly compared and modern design, pleasant to use! Birthday treats & other bonuses: 500MB birthday bonus. When I first signed up there was also a port-in bonus, if you're switching over from another local telco. You also get referral bonus (200 MB per month for every new customer who signs up using your referral code) so there's actually no limit to the amount of bonus data you can get out of Circles.Life. Here are some of the bonuses which I have, according to the app:"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"Had been a loyal M1 customer since my poly days till fatherhood (35yo) & I remb the days when M1 rewarded their loyal customers with birthday vouchers yearly, till recent few years they have stopped giving and I had to call & 'beg' for them if I wanted to recontract or sign up new phones. Changed to Circle Life mainly for the savings of monthly bills & since they are using M1 network, I have the same network reception. What I like about Circle is their flexibility for the charges & of course the loyalty rewards (500mb extra every 6mths). Can see this telco having some impacts to the 3 main telcos & just want to say: If you treat your loyal customers well, you can be sure we will stay with you Circle Life!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"I was a Singtel customer since my dad got me the line when I was 15 so that's about 20 years. The push factor was that I never, EVER felt like I was being treated like a loyal customer. In fact, I've had too many instances where they were just plain low balling me (e.g. Birthday treats can't be redeemed, mysterious charges on the bill). But it wasn't easy leaving a long-term relationship no matter how detrimental it might be. Plus, I was a singtel circle member so I got free data on Sundays."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"Circles Life has got to be the most value-added telco service. These are the few reasons why: 1) They are generous with their data! I live for data, and they understand customers like us (hahaha) 2) Great customer service. They could answer my questions so quickly, and settle my concerns. I like that they are so easy to reach. - sometimes when we want to reach their customer service rep through the app, they dont respond immediately and I dont like to wait with the app on. So by the time I came back to the app after scrolling somewhere else, the conversation was closed by the rep. Can be better managed!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,I have been using Circles for more than a year now and overall pretty happy with the service. 1. Just simply love the amount of customisation options available through their Circles Care App -  No more waiting to get through to customer service over a call 😀. There is even an option to chat with customer service through the app in case a need arises. 
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"It has been exactly a year since I’ve ported over to Circles life from Singtel, and I’m happy to say that it’s been awesome! Not only do I get 6Gb of data monthly, after 6 months of usage, I’m awarded with another 500Mb of monhly data as a loyal customer. On top of that, I get an additional 500mb when it’s my birthday! How cool is that! But there’s one factor which I love about Circles the most, and it’s the connectivity. When I was using SingTel, I often face issues with connectivity when I travel on the MRT. SingTel always resets its connection on certain stations along the track. This gives me problem especially when I’m watching a movie or playing some games. With Circles, this hasn’t been a problem ever since. Hence Circles truly rules with its connectivity! "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"While their customer service and SIM card delivery processes can be better improved, no other complains so far."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"I had done my tour of duty with the three telcos & thought I would stay with green until Circles came along. Great, fast and effective customer service along with value for money plans that gave me what I needed (and not rubbish I don need like 300 mins talk time) ensures that Circles is the one for me. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"1. Short customer service waiting time - If you have a problem with anything, the live chat can get you sorted out. Plus, it takes less than 5 minutes (usually instant) to reach support. Out of 10 problems, 9 times were resolved instantly for me. The other one time took 2 hours as they had to settle something back end. 3. No Physical Shops - Being a digital telco, they don't have any physical shops at all if you want to talk to a live person. However, they hold roadshows from time to time at various parts of Singapore."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4d ago,Purchased,"The CNY package was attractive so I switched over mine and my wife's mobile plan from M1 to MyRepublic. My line was ported over without issue but my wife's took more than a week. Customer service was hard to reach but eventually when engaged the person was helpful and resolved the issue. It took a few days though. Customer service seem to try to hide behind chatbot and website, very hard to contact with no clearly visible phone number shown anywhere. The chatbot is totally useless and website form produces no response. Except for the CS rep whom has been very helpful, overall customer service experience was poor. Also, recently found out MyRepublic does not support mobile phone payment. One of my auto-subscription could not charge successfully. Also my wife's apple watch could not connect to MyRepublic mobile data. Not sure if MyRepublic does not support Apple Watch or what. Not feeling enthusiastic about contacting customer service again!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 4d ago,Purchased,"Switching over to My Republic has been rather easy and smooth. Porting over my number has also been pretty fast. Overall, I'm very happy with the service."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 1w ago,Purchased,"The network is reasonable sound, better than TPG but not comparable to SingTel. Don't expect an immediate response/resolution from the customer service. The Core Plan that I have subscribed is a value for money compared to other service provider"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Non-official hours if anything is much helpless, the FAQs on site etc may not help much but day time, the live chat agent was not bad. Resolved my sudden network cut issue. I am a satisfied customer of 2 mobile lines and would still recommend other to sign up with MR. Kudos!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"Compared to my old line, I found MyRepublic has a wide range of network coverage and Fast network speeds for mobile data. I’m very pleased with MyRepublic stuff and service crew at answering all my questions."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,Is good to use and is value for money for the data usage. The service is good. I believe they will be much more popular than other telco
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"It’s been almost 2 weeks since I tried porting my number over from Starhub. Tried to call their customer service hotline to enquire about the unsuccessful application only to be directed to a chatbot that will direct me to links of articles or answers to FAQ which was extremely unhelpful.  With the unsuccessful porting application, they said they will contact me with the reason only to receive an email with the reason for unsuccessful application with no additional follow up emails on information needed to resubmit the application or the status update of the application. They only resubmitted an application when I sent in a request form only to be informed that my application was unsuccessful. I had to call in to starhub to enquire about it but they told me there was no request from myrepublic to port the number over. I am extremely disappointed in the service I received and I even had to pay for the one month of service already, only to receive this subpar experience. Would not recommend it to any of my friends or family until you learn to improve on your customer service support."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"Network speed could be slightly faster for some grey area. Nonetheless, the 50gb plan for $17 is really worth the value as compared to other service provider."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,"Moving to new telco and porting requests rejected by MyRepublic? Non-existent customer service, keep directing you to chatbot with irrelevant responses. Took to FB and whoever responded went quiet. Send online requests and no response."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 2w ago,Purchased,I have been using My Republic for years now so far do not have any problem. If only you can replace/upgrade my broadband router for free for loyal customers would be most grateful. Hehe...
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"I helped my dad to port in his number from singtel in cny eve. It was very irresponsible of your customer service at lot 1 to change my dad hp number without asking.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 22 Jan 2021,Purchased,I have use before their broadband service in the past and I can say . Never had a problem before.  So this time round I decided to go for them not because of their service but also their affordable legacy plan .

I will recommend those who want to save $$ on Sim only plan to hop on to MR. You will not regret."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 23 Dec 2020,Purchased,Network is tip top. And delivery of SIM card was timely and porting was an ease. Overall pleasant service thus far. Highly recommend MyRepublic if you are big on quality data without having to spend hundreds monthly.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 12 Dec 2020,Purchased,"Reception was ok at beginning and became unstable , weirdly after I ported to another telco realised my phone is speed is up!!!! And I thought it’s my phone problem in the past. Impossible to get customer service via call or chat despite making over 20 attempts. Was charged $10 surcharge for failed payment . Wasn’t apparent in the t and c but nevermind. Took the u limited plan but they refused to show your monthly usage, a sly trick to keep you from porting . Now I port to another telco with 110gb and never will look back. Tolerated sucky service for over a year. My republic keep up the good work and keep oppressing your customers. I sense a mass exodus soon and a chapter 11 on the way. Too frightened of the boo boos to even try them again. My republic mobile does a good job of Messing up and in process create customer opportunity for Singtel StarHub and M1. The other telcos should give my republic a medal for the good work and should ask them to keep it up 👍"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 06 Dec 2020,None,"When you guys just started up, My first service was a broadband line with you guys, for 2 years, I NEVER had to call the customer service line, I NEVER had to go through any service disruption, basically for 2 years, I just pay my bills on time. When my contract expired, I took another 2 years with you guys. I also ported my personal mobile line, my parents line to you guys. Same thing, NEVER had to call the customer service line and etc and even though there was one bad mobile service disruption. You guys handled it well, but announcing and did your best to restore the service."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 12 Nov 2020,Purchased,"Although it is on M1 network and there are many horror stories about how bad it is, I have not personally experienced any significant slowdown / loss of network myself (There are spots in my house where the data is weaker than Starhub but not unusable). The plan is great value for money (Signed up during flash sales and got 50GB for only $17, much better than what Circles.Life and others offer). The only downside was I engaged their support team before and they gave incorrect advice regarding the flash sales. Otherwise, it has been great and definitely recommend this!"

Really need the speed for gaming, watching Youtube videos, streaming and download large work files. [Customer Service] This department is the best! Still freshly remember that time when my network is down at 2am, I call them up and they gladly to help and guide me patiently to reset my router. And making sure that my network is up and running when they called me back after I troubleshoot the router's issue. Lastly, even though there are some negative comments from the customers and high doubts from non-customers of porting over, take that as a challenge to improve, fulfill your customer's requirements, showing your best to promo good plans to non-customers.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,"However, porting over from Singtel encountered some issues which required escalation to their backend team for investigation. Even though both the app and chat support told me my number porting was successful, that was not the case. I was still on the temporary number. My original number had been ported and deactivated (M1 automated message: ""line not in use"" when I tried to dial). IIRC, that took less than a week to resolve but had caused inconvenience whenever accessing services required SMS OTPs."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,"I have just signed up with MyRepublic, the line seems ok and the service was great when I sign up.  Hassle free and the SIM card was delivered to me in 3 days."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,Tried different mvno. This suits me the best and most affordable especially outgoing and incoming calls from overseas. My wife got convinced and our family is using the same plan. Porting is simple and trouble free. I was unavailable for the initial delivery. The online chat was seamless and helpful to setup another delivery date in just a minute. I wish other telco would provide value and service as good as myrepublic.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,"I am a MyRepublic customer since 2014, the network line is better than others telco, this month I will recontract my line too. Hope MyRepublic will do better and have their own network line for future"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Nov 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] I had a porting issue and had to do all the homework myself on why the porting was unsuccessful. MyRepublic had happily deducted the money from my credit card but porting was unsuccessful. There was no way to get in touch with the customer service. We are expected to speak to a chatbot to solve our matters. This is one aspect that MyRepublic needs to buck up.  MyRepublic, you have got a great value for money plans and amazing marketing (the kiddy fonts that you used in Ms-Word and you dared to use it in Facebook? it somehow enticed me!) but what are those things when we cannot reach you to solve our issue? When there is a fire breaking out, are you expecting the citizens to talk to a chatbot? Customers do not like to hang on the line and talk to the CS too"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 05 Nov 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] I only got problem getting thru with the customer service even though I used the apps to chat. Longer waiting time and till no respond. Even i left a message but it's ok. I hope problem will settled. Overall, it's outstanding."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Jul 2020,Purchased,This is a simple and extremely affordable no-fuss plan. The data connection speed is comparable to other major telcos and the phone connection is also stable. What I like the most is there is no excess data usage even if you go beyond the allocated data (except that the connection speed is compromised). Payment is via debit/credit deduction monthly. The app is also basic  and user friendly. Overall it is highly recommended.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Jul 2020,Purchased,"The customer service is very helpful. The porting is very easy and fast, you need not to do anything. However, the data signal is very weak. Very often can't get the signal."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 08 Jul 2020,Purchased,I have been a regular subscriber of this telco. Currently I am paying $8 for the monthly 1GB plan which I think is one of the cheapest so far. But competitors are now providing better offerings. So MyRepublic may have to up its ante to retain its customer base.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Jul 2020,Purchased,"I was formerly a StarHub customer and found the StarHub SIM plans to be quite expensive. So I decided to try out MyRepublic, and the experience has been overwhelmingly positive.  [Customer Service] The only hicccup occurred when I was signing up for 2 SIM cards and had to use different email accounts, but the MyRepublic team quickly responded to my request to bring the 2 SIM cards under 1 account and email id. The application process can be fine-tuned in this aspect, to allow a new MyRepublic user to sign up for multiple services at the same time. Overall, a great plan if you’re not a heavy data user, and with more-than-enough SMS and call-time for the average person"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Jul 2020,Purchased,My Republic plan is really value for money! Registration was quick and SIM card was immediately activated. Network and internet speed was stable and fast comparing with the big telco companies. Customer service was also excellent. Keep it up!

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 07 Jul 2020,Purchased,"I changed providers from M1 because I was on an old plan (think about $40 monthly for 4GB!!!). Porting over was a breeze, my enquiries were sent via email or found on the website for MyRepublic while talking to my previous provider to ensure my line was cancelled was actually really difficult - we mistakenly went down to the physical store, and wound up dialling in to their customer service hotline as advised by their website and waited 20 mins before an agent attended to us."

I'm busy and can sometimes be absent minded.  But the best part is that MyRepublic is generous with the data and minutes offered. I'm happy with their customer service,  plans and their coverage.

Hence, I got the customer service to help me change the address and regenerate the bill with the new address. However, they sent me the bill with the old address and they cannot do anything about it. Hence, they suggested I subscribe another line and pay the full amount again with NO REFUND to get the billing address right. This is outrageous!"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 21 May 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] I tried to apply online for a $10/mth plan for my son. After keying in all my details, I was asked to put a $100 deposit based on their ""assessment of my profile"". I find that highly ludicrous, as my profile has no indication of my financial status nor credit rating. In fact, I have never had outstanding mobile bills and I have a good credit rating. The only thing I can deduce is that they suspect a 36 year old woman living in a HDB flat, who has internet access and a credit card to apply for this line, cannot afford to pay $10 a month for a mobile plan. What a big joke. Will boycott My Republic forever!"

Have been calling in for more than a month about the same issue which wastes SO MUCH TIME! When asked about why their service for a particular feature is down, their only response is they don't have a timeline as to when it will be fixed.

Although the promotion is now $18 a month instead of $8, I might consider signing up for my mum next month! Thanks MR!! "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 20 Aug 2019,None,Excellent customer service. The officers are quick to help solve problems and are always courteous. Internet connection for mobile is great. Broadband at home is OK. Sometimes signalling goes on and off in the morning between 10am - 1pm.

Price is fixed & it is boundless data, who wouldnt love it?!??! "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 19 Aug 2019,None,"So far I think MyRepublic is the best telco that I ever have after tried many telcos. The plan price is very reasonable, The MyRepublic Talk app can allow you to make roaming calls at local rates & the customer service response is fast & good."

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,Tried myrepublic mobile service for around 1.5mths. Signal reception really not as good as M1 which I had been using for more than 15yrs.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Reasonable rates but customer service not too good. Not many plans to choose from. Slow internet speed.
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Customer service via phone takes a long time but expected. Best way to contact them is via messenger. Mobile broadband is generally quite fast and stable. Using it for gaming is generally stable as well. Telco service is good and convenient since you can buy roaming data via the app. Coverage is not fantastic but decent enough. They have great online services like app and messenger but via telephone takes a long time. I don't mind actually as I feel messenger is more convenient.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Have been using their mobile line for more than a year. They do not have the best coverage but it’s worth the price. Even after excess your monthly data quota, the buffered speed is still good enough for normal website surfing and Facebook scrolling. Will have issue streaming YouTube video though. Their customer service is one of the best I encountered. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Jun 2019,None,"Mobile plan is value for money. However, the delivery was messed up. The delivery guy did not check the delivery information and wasted my time to make a trip for collection. Online Customer service and support is bad.

Last year I had a question on what the whatsapp or IG/FB data packs cover... They did not bother to reply me at all. Now, I have a referral but did not earn the Gigabucks.

Seriously work on the improving customer support. otherwise, people will move to other providers."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 10 Jan 2021,None,"[Customer Service] Customer service is way way below expectation. Be be prepared not to get the required support for issue beyond their FAQs. There is simply no one you can relate your peculiar issues and problems. You can only use the irritating Chat Bot, Leave a message and wait for up to 72 hours for the respond. Nothing beats speaking to a Live person for urgent and peculiar issue for resolution. Although the plans are very competitive, but I believe many will not hesitate to switch out if the Customer Service/Support is not responsive to customer's issues."

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 22 Dec 2020,Purchased,"I first ported over to giga when they were first introduced and hopped on the (back then) $18 for 20gb plan which has now been upgraded to 40gb. Customer service used to be quick and efficient but it is now absolutely terrible and a pain to contact customer service for assistance. The mobile app is also terrible and it doesn't always load although it is slightly better now. Would rate customer support as zero stars if possible. The live agent does not work at all and the support staffs do not reply to their email. I have been contacting them for almost a month now to try to change my credit card on my account but customer service either does not reply or provides responses asking for a screenshot and then completely disappears after I send a screenshot of my error message. I believe I am not the only one facing issues with credit card as my family member is encountering the same issue and I saw reviews on seedly of people mentioning this same error.  I sent my last follow up email 5 days ago requesting for assistance (their automated replies state that I will receive a reply within 72 hours but I only receive a reply after I send a second follow up email after 72 hours) and have yet to receive a reply from them. I have made it clear that I was absolutely dissatisfied with their terrible service and have made known to them that I will file an official complain to IMDA for this lack of customer support. If it is a problem with manpower, they absolutely should try to hire more support staff given how much they've grown thus far, and if the credit card issue was a technical error, they could at least kindly inform me that they are trying to fix it instead of completely not replying to all the emails I have sent them. I believe I am not the only one who is unhappy with this lack of customer support from giga and would urge anyone who feels the same to contact me so we can lodge a complain to IMDA together as I believe if I were to do so alone, IMDA would not take it seriously. Still stuck with giga for now because their plans are really one of the most value for money but I will not hesitate to hop to another telco should this terrible service continue."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 27 Nov 2020,Purchased,I’m very happy with my giga plan. The sim was delivered to my house very soon and porting and setting it up for use was a breeze. The network is fast and I have no problems so far. The pricing for the plans are one of the best and they frequently surprise me with pop up deals and perks too. Sometimes they even give additional data for free! The app is very user friendly with cool profile animations and shows you all your usage stats in one glance. You can easily view the pricing for all the add-ons and easily add them within seconds in the app. There is a chat for customer support within the app and I usually get a reply within seconds. Overall I highly recommend giga! for SIM only plans.

I have also reached them via email on Sunday night, but now its Tuesday morning and no one gotten back to me. Without network and worrying about people calling and not able to call out is very very disruptive and im very very disappointed no attempt was made to contact me to change the SIM card.

Initially, webpages can load but about 5 minutes into using the data, webpages fail to load. It is incredibly frustrating. I have written to Giga explaining the problem but have not gotten a single response from them. I am cancelling my subscription as there is no point paying for a non existent service."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 17 Nov 2020,Purchased,"I have been using GIGA! for more than a year now. I'm very happy with the service and the connection.  At first, I was hesitant whether to sign up with this company as I noticed there's no customer service line and I have to depend on the chat function on the App to connect to a customer service person. But all my fears were unwarranted when I realized how quick the number can be ported. Not just that, the billing and upgrade was seamless. I did not even need to reach out to any customer service person at all.  The app is easy to use and you can self-service to add on data, roaming etc any time.  I was previously a Starhub customer and I did not feel any difference in the 4G or data connection. The network is good. Prior to COVID, I also subscribe to GIGA! roaming plan before. The network connection was fantastic in Malaysia and Thailand."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 17 Nov 2020,Purchased,"GIGA had the worst network over, it keep hovering in-between 3G/4/G network.

App when the only form of help is an autobot? Been trying to port over for the past week and raised an email ticket to the actual live customer service team but have yet to receive any form of response. This is frustrating as it would mean that I’ve to pay for both existing telco and giga!’s mobile line which doesn’t make sense at all? Customer service timeline of ‘within 72 hours’ wasn’t met.

The reception has been great (not much difference compared to my previous telco provider), and the porting process was seamless as well. There hasn't been much issue for me to contact customer service, so wouldn't be able to comment on that (but I guess that's a great thing?).

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 05 Aug 2020,Purchased,I have been using Giga for nearly a year. Overall great service and not many problems. There are sometimes network drops to H+ and have to restart my phone to get 4G. Highly recommended to people who are looking for reasonable sim only plan service. Go #giga

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 04 Aug 2020,Purchased,"I tried a lot of other mobile plan/networks and so far Giga is the best. Normally cheaper mobile network tends to be unstable but Giga rides on the Starhub so its very stable and the range is superb. Customer service can be reached easily within the app, very convenient and fast. The porting in is a bit slower than circle line but still acceptable. I like that Giga has smaller package to suit my useage I do not have to pay more for the data I do not need, and in months I need more, can always buy the extra in just a heartbeat on the app. Roaming and international data can also be bought extra with super cheap price that I dont need to change sim. I introduce to a lot of friends and they all have very nice experience. It can not be better than this."

Nothing more I could ask for 👍🏻 Have not contacted customer service because there’s no reason for me to do so."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 04 Aug 2020,Purchased,I have been enjoying GIGA service since port over from singtel (had been a singtel user for > 20 years).  took a bold step to switch over as it is more economical for me to convert to the lowest plan since being retrenched.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 28 Jul 2020,None,"Took only about 1 working day for my SIM to arrive + for my network to switch over? Very seamless. Also obvious that giga is very customer-focused cos I can't ""accidentally"" exceed my data anymore 💸, and the plan has a lot of free add-ons which other telcos will charge for... which I appreciate! So far the network speed has been really solid too so it's def a great deal."
Level 6. Master,Updated on 23 Jul 2020,None,Not 5 stars for network because I think the coverage still does not beat Singtel but honestly I think it will work for the average person. It was only slow to the point of cannot use in military camp which is in a 'ulu' place. But else where its legit like Singtel speed. I think giga most value in terms of gb/$ plus got free rollover. now i'm on a promo plan $20 for 40gb (orginally $18 for $20). i don't like circles promos because they seem like temporary like for customer acquisition only but later on doesn't really reward loyal customers so i go for giga which is value throughout. app wise the animation a bit lag but who cares. never tried the customer support so can't comment.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Jul 2020,Purchased,The apps are simple and easy to use despite minimum personal attention. Well done. The rolling over of data monthly is good. But the Call time could be increased.

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 25 Jun 2020,None,"Porting was seamless and done without any hiccup. The customer's role in the porting process besides signing up is to exchange the Sim card. Porting was done quickly, and you will receive updates from Giga via SMS on the successful porting.  One of the best if not the best mobile app experience. The quirky designs and colour scheme might be a personal taste issue. However, the experience of using the app is outstanding. Information you need are prominently placed and easy to read. Addons are well laid out. Information about each addon is clearly stated. Billing is done on the app without being redirected to another webpage. Its surprising to see GIGA with a much well-designed app than Starhub's offering. You can easily add/upgrade/downgrade your line with ease in App. [Customer Service] The weakest component of Giga. Customer service is just bad. Response time is painfully slow. This is written based on my initial experience with them hence I’m not sure if any improvements have been made. Thankfully, I only have to reach out to them once. This shows the reliabilty of their service.  Giga! has increible potential to deliver the best mobile experience once they figure out how to fix their customer support issues. It is still my favourite telco and have since ported mutiple lines over."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 23 Jun 2020,None,"[Billing] The beauty of giga is you will not experience bill shock. It’s a postpaid service on a prepaid platform.  Please note that I am rating this based on above mentioned experience. I have not came across any customer service with them because I didn’t went into any communication with them, which I know I try to avoid knowing how service level has lapsed over the service industry over the years just like M1.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 23 Jun 2020,Purchased,"I enjoy the stability and the speed giga! provides. With giga!, I forgot how it feels to be frustrated over a laggy connection.

I asked for help from the live chat since it's the only way to contact them instantly and directly, but the agents complicate things even further, lacked professionalism in responses and offered literally no viable solutions.  What doesn't help the situation is how Giga responds to all complaints here with the model answer of ""contacting our live chat"". With no solutions provided during live chat, nor evaluation and improvements made in response to the complaints, it really reflects their limited customer care."

It's obviously 4, but the wall doesn't say anything back. The things I am asking their customer service to do is very normal for CS staff to handle, but they just ignore you. They make you wait for hours, tell you submit feedback, ignore your emails, ignore your submitted feedback. And then at the end they have the cheek to ask you for more patience. If you ever get charged the wrong amount, forget trying to get it back. Get charged $100 for some roaming service you didn't activate? Too bad, it's gone forever. giga! = thief."

I called M1 and said no issues on their side for me to port over to gomo. So okay, i wait until 30 Dec to chat with their officer on the gomo app. Officer asks me to fill in a form as there was some mismatch in the personal details which is already super stange if i only key in my own details. I fill in the form, officer acknowledges receipt and tells me to wait 24-48 hrs for the confirmation sms. Up till today, 4 Jan, no confirmation email sent so I chat with another officer on the gomo app who tells me that there don't have an account registered under my name. So i get my husband to ask another officer again and this time that officer tells me that they had sent me an sms on 21 dec to inform me that they were going to cancel my plan because i didn't fill in the form to verify my personal details. B) why do my personal details not match in the first place when I keyed them in correctly. C) customer service officers clearly are not helpful. Claim that they informed me via sms of the cancellation and no refund. Is this a scam or what?? They advertise promo they cancel contract on customers and claim no refund."

They replied say it's in the FAQ that number need to be active and hence non-refundable. They said I need to get a new number and new plan from them. I asked for their supervisor and they replied that will take 24-48 hrs. I left my email and HP for contact purposes before leaving the chat. Their sign up process only warned about early termination and contracted ended sim card during porting, did not warn about inactive sim card."

Nevertheless, it still acceptable for the low price we paid: $20  My old plan ends on 17th. I started the GOMO plan 1 day earlier hoping that there will be continual service after I ported over.  GOMO agents should advise the customers on this, rather than blindly port over. "

The pro is cheaper than retail pricing but less data usage and I'm always needed high data but of course more data needs to pay more. Ever since gomo came out, I signed up the new line and it was fast enough to receive the sim card. The setup was easy. The chatbot is user friendly unless you have complicated issue may need some time to resolve. Payment is very simple by linking your cc or debit card and it will automatically renew for you and the app does showed you the next plan renewal date. It also gives you many attractive data rewards in a few months etc 20gb. Overall the experience is great."

Only good thing is data amount. and tracking of usage."

No significant complains about network coverage or connectivity but would perhaps recommend a contact number which customers can be linked up to should they need more info and clarifications that could not be found in the FAQ or via the chat.  Currently the only way to check out info is only via the GOMO website and by ""talking/messaging"" the client agent online, no personal touch at all."

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 05 Nov 2020,Purchased,"Been using GOMO for 1 year now. Porting in from Singtel is quite easy, takes about 3 working days for them to deliver the SIM chip. I initially had some trouble trying to contact customer support because I could only reach their virtual assistant on the website and needed to wait for a while. However, I feel that Gomo is a no-fuss plan, it's easy to track my GB usage on their app, and the network is as reliable as Singtel's, have had no issues at all with network connections. Every 2 months or so Gomo gives out freebies such as free 10GB, or a free Burple subscription for 2 months, etc. Not really necessary for me but I think it's nice."

They apologize ever time you express your frustration and dissatisfaction and continue doing the same, i.e., if you decide to switch to GOMO, you decide to introduce all these absurdity to your life. [Mobile App] sending you useless promo / updates but does not resolve your issues nor get you to the right person (if GOMO does have such a person)"

They kept delaying replies and giving me responses which did not help in my situation. I got annoyed sitting infront of my screen typing the same problem to the numerous online staff that were trying to help solve my problem. They were just not apt to solve it and I wasn't able to use my GOMO sim even though I paid for it and was not able to get a refund as well. Overall terrible experience"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 04 Oct 2020,Purchased,"The second time was at the 6h mark of no service. This particular chatline staff was slightly better, apologised promptly and told me to wait till 2am because that’s the peak working hour of getting lines fixed.  At the 16h mark, I have had to grapple with being uncontactable at work, being unable to even log in to wireless sg without a line and unable to book a grab for transport. I contacted them again and a chatline staff by the name of Marielle just insisted I wait the full 24h. I asked for answers but all she told me was that it has already been raised to the relevant department. I asked how long more then do I have to wait? She said 24h. Once again, no answers, no service recovery, no callback offer.  Come on gomo. Your service recovery is non existent. And being a telco do you think going 48h without a line is reasonable? And to tell me that the IT people don’t work on weekends so I can only possibly get my line up and running tomorrow,72h later?????? "

Even their customer support didnt do anything ( didnt do their job can say ), didnt follow up your case, no apology at all very bad.

Good thing its carried by the first-jobber bright-eyed-bushy-tailed youth promoters. But I digress, the best thing about this port-over service is that the SIM card was couriered without the hassle of enduring long queues. What a relief!"

I had to contact them at least 3 times as the solution given by the 1st and 2nd agent was not working (I had to end the chat as I needed to test the mobile tethering on my computer which the live chat was on). Every time I spoke to the agent, I had to repeat the story again as it is a different person. As much as you can, make sure you settle the issue with that agent before ending that chat else you will need to re-explain everything again when you connect the next time. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 02 May 2020,None,Edit: I’ve been using GOMO for more than half a year now and upgraded my overall experience from a 4-star to a 5-star! I’ve been satisfied by everything so far and there has been even more reasons for me that I’ve discovered for me to recommend this service! 
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 27 Apr 2020,Purchased,"Everything has been smooth sailing for me, i've been using GOMO for a couple of months. Already a singtel user i had to pay an upfront fee to port the line over to a sim-only. Other than that, fees have been $20 monthly auto-deduction as usual. The customer support is, however, trash. ""Chat"" function on the app worked once. When I tried again, the message couldnt't go through and yeah I just gave up because I didn't have a pressing need."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Apr 2020,Purchased,Then I went thru their retarded website bot (like 14 times) and got a human support finally. The person say NO REFUND once delivery starts. WTF? I got no service from your sh1tty sim pay me back my $20.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Mar 2020,Purchased,"In my opinion, Singtel GOMO provides the best value for sim only plans. Billing is easy where payment is automatically deducted from your bank account monthly. Besides that, easy to sign up as it can be done online and sim card will be delivered to you. However, they are lacking in terms of customer service. When signing up for this plan, I encountered some difficulties and I was looking for some form of customer support. Tried using the robo chat which apparently was the only way for me to talk to someone, but didn't manage to have my queries cleared. There wasn't any contact number on their GOMO site therefore I decided to contact Singtel, only to be told by the staff that the robo chat was the only way for me to contact someone. After many times of trying to search for an answer from the robo chat, I was finally directed to a customer service personnel. It wasn't clear that I had to search multiple times, and only be directed if I couldn't have my queries cleared, which actually resulted in me wasting so much time trying to contact someone."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Mar 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] [Ease of porting] Literally got scammed by Gomo since they refused to redeliver or refund my SIM card when I missed the first delivery; they should consider clarifying that one delivery attempt is all you'll get. They basically made me pay $20 for a failed delivery attempt, and claimed I took too long to reschedule (too long defined as 9 working days) after misdirecting me to SingPost on my first attempt with customer support. Went through customer support 6 times (yes, that's 6 times I interacted with their infamous chatbot too) and each ended with either misdirection or eventual rejection by supervisors for redelivery or refund request, even when the customer support representatives proposed said resolutions.  So in the end, I have a $20 deficit with no Gomo plan that I paid for; simply appalling that an established business (in this case Singtel) can receive payment without delivering stated service. Claims of best network are pointless when your users can't even have a decent port in or customer support experience. "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Mar 2020,Purchased,"I applied for the Sim only mobile plan. I paid the $20, and waited for notifications on collection but didn’t receive anything, no SIM card, no email, no SMS. 2 months later, I asked from the customer service, they said I can’t get the refund because apparently, it’s according to their policy that they don’t give refund if SIM card is lost, damaged, expired or terminated. They did asked me to call SingPost regarding the delivery but it was my fault that I didn’t because I forgot. But I didn’t receive any email/sms regarding the delivery. How is it fair?

Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 18 Feb 2020,Purchased,Customer Service is absolutely absymal. They give you all sorts of reasons even though you want something simple like a billing problem to be solved.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 18 Feb 2020,Purchased,200 sms is not 200 outgoing sms but they simply stop the service to ask you to add more. And the customer didn’t even bother when i told them that it was only the 10th day it can’t be so many sms sent as i only sms my daughter to check her whereabouts.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Feb 2020,Purchased,"Horrendous customer service.  Firstly, i had to change over ownership of the number from my parents to myself. I purchased the GOMO plan, before proceeding down to my service provider to transfer ownership. I had to pay $20+ for the transfer of ownership but that's alright. After that, i was informed that i had to commit to a minimum 1 month SIM only plan. My GOMO sim was scheduled to be collected in 2 days. I don't understand their rationale as I informed them early 2 days prior to my collection date. Assuming that collection can be done as soon as next day, obviously they haven't started with the application/port over yet. Such a shame that the company is covetous over that $20 and gave up on the possibility of a long-term customer. Extremely disappointed with the service that I got and would seek another provider instead."

I and my 5 family members moved to Gomo and we have all lost our numbers that we wanted ported over. Customer service seem to be a team of robots who just reply with generic link to self-service for porting over number. However, for this self-service to work you have to still have access to your old number, which I don't It's the worst customer service I have ever received. It's also false advertising as they say they'll port the number over but they don't. Other networks that "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 27 Oct 2019,Purchased,"Giving it a month to see if the coverage improves, living ten minutes from a town, gomo has a coverage map that says in my area the coverage is excellent 4g, on a rare occasion 4g is available, always 3G and two or three bars on iPhone. This isn’t good enough as three are able to have 4g consistently. Do not rely on their coverage map if in a rural area(if ten mins from a town either side is rural). Contacted their customer service who told me the 4g mast was down in my area. Was tempted to message back and offer my services to go to the location and put the mast back up. Didn’t appreciate being spoofed by someone who had no clue what they were talking about. Point is these phone companies offer a service that is not what you get, for ten euro a month to struggle to load a page on your phone in 2019 is ridiculous. Maybe don’t jump ship to gomo so quickly until you see what other people in your area make of the service. If anyone is skilled in putting back up masts please contact gomo they clearly need a hand."

Level 4.

I'm expecting service/signal quality to be good compare to M1 as i travel to work on purple line. M1 reception is very bad in the purple line tunnel with frequent disconnection. 
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 21 Aug 2019,None,Totally recommend for value & cost-effectiveness. ($20 per month is awesome!)

As a new customer, I can't remember the exact amount of talktime available and I referred to the app. To my horror, it was inaccurate when it stated 1100 mins talk time when in fact I only had 100 mins talk time. The support is hopeless too, incapable of making a decision and just pushing my case around. If u r not going to JB, it's not worth it. Use GIGA instead."
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 05 Jul 2020,None,"Signing up at their local agent store was a breeze, took just 10 minutes in total. The agent took out a redONE tablet, keyed in my personal particulars, including a digital photograph of my NRIC. I was given a new redONE SIM card. NO payment was given. The billing cycle will start from every 1st of the month.  During the NDP month of August, every user was given an extra 2GB data allocation.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 14 Jan 2020,Purchased,"Porting was fast in one working day after midnight. Since it's piggyback on Starhub network, the quality is good and comparable to M1. In some crowded areas the network is smoother. Customer service is fast and helpful to my enquiries. I have the chance to use the roaming service in JB, was a little concerned about the negative comments. Fortunately it was a smooth experience for me, I logged on to Maxis 4G most of the time in auto network mode and was able to surf as per normal.

Tried all sorts of ways as per advised by customer chat representative. None of them worked. Even went to phone shops for assistance. Phone is OnePlus 7t. Because of this, I decided to switch to GIGA but was unable to port-in successfully. Emailed redOne only to find out that I had arrears (of which I did not know) and that they've cut the line without informing me whatsoever. Paid the arrears because I seriously couldn't take them anymore only to find out that I had to pay $20 to reconnect the line if I wanted to port-in successfully to GIGA and redOne was unable to waive those charges even when it was their fault. Extremely disappointed."

Signing up through redONE agent is a seamless 10mins process, my mobile number is automatically activated within 2 hours after signing up. Sign up now to enjoy free registration! (redONE website indicates that their registration fees of SGD30 is waived until further notice, you must still pay a one-off sim card fees of SGD10) The redONE SG 1App is very user friendly, it allows you to track the usage for all your redone mobile numbers.

There are people who aren't heavy users, and only require very basic call and data usage. In this aspect, redONE has not only filled a unique market gap, but has also found their niche on cross-border services. This is truly the perfect telco for Malaysians commuting daily to Singapore for work, and a lifesaver for Singaporeans making occasional trips to Malaysia, but do not want to activate roaming and incur extra roaming charges. My initial gripe was that they do not have an actual shopfront for signing-up. But the good news is, they have quite a number of venues (they call it 'agents') in which you can register for their service. I signed up for mine at Challenger Bugis. A lady working at Challenger did the registration for me using an iPad. Entire process only took about 10-15 mins. Not bad for a first impression. Why can't other telcos be this efficient?! I've been using the service for about a month now. No issues so far. Usage can easily be monitored on their app. I made my first payment through the app too. Never been happier with a telco. This is truly a gem."
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 12 Dec 2019,Purchased,The porting from M1 to redONE is really hassle free and it took about a day to complete. The Android app is well designed and user friendly. The customer service is prompt and reliable. I find that the network is better than my previous telco. The speed is fast and I have not experienced any issue yet. I am really satisfied with the service and would gladly recommend it to my friends and family.

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 20 Nov 2019,Purchased,"So far I have been using redONE's amazing 8 plan and it has been just as good as Telcos such as Singtel or Starhub, just to name a few. With the plan I have, featuring 3G and 100min of calls and 1000min of calls to other redONE users. This only makes the plan much more worth it. Additionally, redONE's Data and Call services are reliable and doesn't really cause me any trouble. The only downside to the plan is the limited amount of messages I have, but I understand the reason for that. So far I am very pleased and satisfied with redONE's services and look forward to continue seeing improvements on their hand. "

After my trial has ended I decided to continue only to find that they have double charged my credit card and refuse to provide any response on the matter.

If you are interested in the cheap plans here, prepare for a world of annoyance when things go wrong."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 21 Nov 2020,Purchased,"Signed up for the trial initially. After the trial ended, I wish to cancel 3 of the sim cards and kept 1 of the plan. Submitted cancellation before the trial ended via the website. After the trial ended, first month, there is no issue with the existing plan that I am holding. At the 2nd month, I suddenly realised I am being charge 3 times and when I submitted for customer support and even raise the issue with IMDA, there isn’t anything done. I checked through all accounts and no reflection in any of the invoices. Due to the suspicious transaction, I did a chargeback with the bank and they change a credit card for me. The sim cards are subsequently all terminated as the telecom is not able to charge my card any more. I will advise against getting TPG as no customer support and no proper invoicing."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 16 Nov 2020,Purchased,Used its free trial service and decided to subscribed paid service thinking the signal reception would be better. Nope. Not that $10 is a lot but its unreliable signal reception and erratic billing led me to drop it. I rather pay $15 more to get sim only from Singtel or M1.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 06 Oct 2020,None,"Network is known to be poor, especially inside the MRT tunnel. It's also unreliable depending where you use the service. Since I live near the central, so I met with fewer issues. Customer service is the worst part of TPG Mobile. There is none, strictly speaking and you must be the type of customer who can tolerate and ignore any indifference of the service from your other mobile services unless you have time (an hour or two) to queue to talk to counter staff. Emailing TPG is as good as talking to the wall. No reply unless you are extremely lucky.  If you can let go the cheap subscription, there is no reason you should use its service for a peace of mind. Many uses it as the second line for data and it still gives you enough trouble and it's never a free lunch around."

Other than that, whatever digital customer service channels they have are just for display. Extremely slow response or even no response. With the rise of the complaints, hopefully they are improving the customer service quality now. Poor mobile app lacks of a lot of features, hard to trace the usage or manage the service. The web portal also the same. As a full fledged telco, they really offer affordable services. If they could improve their customer service, they can really be a potential threats to the other telcos."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 01 Sep 2020,None,[Customer Service] Im not one to leave reviews but this really pissed me off and this is one of the worst customer service i ever faced.

Which i did so on their website even months / weeks before till they say they will email me once its terminated its been 3 weeks? Since my line has expired but theres no response no email no responses on their website and FB.

There were many people encountered the issues for example the sim card is not on service after activated, not able to surf internet, charged more than one time to their debit/credit card for subscription, cancellation and refund are not processed upon request etc.This is the worst telco in Singapore.

When come to a promoting really great but comes to a problem they just ignore. I have topup my wallet a few times but my line is not working. only the 1st month is ok comes to 2nd month onwards its so bad... With this kind of provider i will not recommend to others. Even $10 is worth the value but this is not the way to do business by leaving our problem in the air.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 08 Jul 2020,Purchased,"I must admit this plan offers the best deal. Although the customer service and response is really slow. It would help to beef up the portal for self service. Underground service is still lacking but as I am not a heavy user, for the price I can accept its limitations. With these shortcomings improved, I am sure that TPG will be able to take over the market from the big players!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 04 Jul 2020,Purchased,"Account setup is basic. I had to submit the user data three times as I was not able to figure out how to add additional lines under the same account. Also, looks like you can forget voice/chat related customer service, and email seems to be the only option. But I don't mind that. M1 customer service was not great in any case. For $10 per month for 50GB and 300 minutes, TPG is a phenomenal deal that I am happy to get and forgo some human being hand holding me. After 15 years of forking out cash to M1, I am delighted to give a hungry startup that is offering terrific value my money."

Level 8. Wizard,Updated on 02 May 2020,None,"Have been using TPG for more than a year as they extended the trial period and pushed back their official launch date. It has been pretty reliable so far, except when underground when the signal totally cuts off. They've finalised their plan, $10 per month for quite a lot of data. But personally, I wouldn't go for it as they do not support coverage underground. "

But speeds fluctuate - although I think that's a problem with their local telcos than with TPG. You can't actually port over currently if you want the unlimited data promo. I had to apply for a new number. The experience applying was alright, but it was troublesome that I had to go down to collect the SIM card in person, especially when all their competitors ship the SIM card to your doorstep now."

The network is pretty stable when you're above ground, but there is absolutely zero connection when you're in the tunnel (MCE) or on the underground train lines. Customer service is standard, and you need to have LTE in order to use the voice calls. Not sure if there's a mobile app tied to it? "

Voice calls are via Voice-over-LTE --- For my phone (Xiaomi) - had to enter a special code to force the VoLTE mode - if your phone doesn't support it (apparently Apple didn't before ?!?) then can't really use this as mainline SIM as won't be able to take calls...  Its pretty unreliable even for my Xiaomi - if calling a business number which has some redirects in place, the system may fail and get a recorded message (with Aussie accent no less!) saying service failed.

I might have been the most pushy customer during the purchase and port-in process but they handled almost everything superbly. First response to a chat took minutes, first response to an email was done within the same day. This is refreshing compared to how customer service was handled over at Giga.  To each their own, but personally I find the use of eKYC smart. It allows Grid Mobile to send the SIM card via post as opposed to having a courier sending it down and physically verifying you. Very useful for people who are usually out and about and may not have anyone at home to attend to mail.  However so, would love to put a little 'g' on my home screen, perhaps Grid Mobile could make a more iOS-friendly shortcut (sorry, not sure about how it works on Android!) where users can just add to home screen a nice icon that automatically opens the gridPortal while waiting for an app?

Overall, I am satisfied with this MVNO as 40gb for $24.90 is really a steal. I am not able to finish using it every month. Free incoming calls/sms, free caller ID, 200 mins outgoing and 200 sms. They also offer rebate points for referrals or for staying with the service, which can be used to offset bills. This is very unique and my favourite reason for using this service (besides the affordable price). CSO is also readily available to chat with at their website, though not 24/7. "

Sadly, this year customer service has gotten from bad to worse. Wait time was bad and when they promised to call back within two hours, they never did.

I had assured my fren that M1 CS is very good and will always try to help esp when you needed to place another order and not completely cancel the contract. Even though 1627 told me it was possible, 1623 was insistent it would not change the order or allow a cancellation in any manner. It was very disappointing to me and my fren.

I am still using M1 and have changed some of my other family members telco to M1 to take advantage of the multiple corporate discount.

Overall, I am still a supporter of M1. On a whole, I'm glad I changed to this telco because of the good customer service and reliability. The transfer from one telco to M1 was seamless and I had no cut off in my network which was great because it would have been troublesome to be without my phone line. Secondly, would like to praise the customer service for being fast and helpful. There were times in the past years that I have i) lost my sim card and ii) needed help with network overseas that I needed to call in to the customer service and they have been nothing short of helpful. Even overseas, they manage to waive my overseas call charges to them. I have since also changed my mum's line to be under my name to enjoy corporate discounts and even the transfer for that was smooth and seamless. I love love love the service given by M1.

Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 12 Dec 2019,Purchased,"25 bucks for more than enough data, keep your number when porting from starhub/singtel, no lock in. I saved about 15 bucks per month sim only and sacrificed nothing at all. Payment app could be easier but I can probably get that fixed if I give it some time. Good service from the shop"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 05 Dec 2019,None,"[Customer Service] Contacted CS hotline 1622 today and connected to a CS representative named Polly Tan. Queried about a SUNSURF charge of $25 billed to me. Was informed that this is a satellite roaming provider. So i guess I must have forgotten to put phone on flight mode. This is my fault and I own it. I am on an Enterprise12+ plan and gets free roaming supposedly. By bringing this up, her polite retort to me was it's only for land providers. I asked for a waiver as I was really not aware my phone was roaming whilst up in the plane, never thought my netwo"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 13 Nov 2019,None,"M1 has the best value in terms of Plan with Device as compared to its competitors. I have ported over from Singtel, process for porting was relatively fuss-free and customer service from the store was great, I have signed with M1 on their Corporate Individual Scheme plan - the best deal for anyone who prefers to have big data, decent talktime and the low upfront cost to pay for phones you desire to have. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 13 Nov 2019,Purchased,"M1 a Singapore telco mobile carrier has once been honourable and provided very good service. Even better than Singtel. But now the service simply sucks and was dishonest and unprofessional. Even violate the original contractual obligations. Very unreliable network and very rude and unprofessional service manager that refuse to do anything to help regain the network connectivity. Dishonourable and dishonest and poor service level. Calling M1 call centres used to be free if calling from M1 mobile numbers but now they even charge airtime if you call the M1 call centres for help. Being one of the best to now the WORST.  That's M1 Mobile Service, Singapore"

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 17 Oct 2019,None,But during I port over time the customer service girl informed me about the connection problem in jurong island
Level 6. Master,Posted on 20 Sep 2019,None,Was initially with Starhub but moved over to M1 for the family plan (Multi-Service Saver) but mad regrets because it has such poor connection... and I only have 6gb a month 😭
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 19 Sep 2019,None,The plans are not so much fantastic. Staffs are ok in service. But plans are too pricey. Customer service are ok. Not much free gift products. The points redeemtion are limited. 
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 19 Sep 2019,None,Have been using M1 for a long time and has always been satisfied with their service and internet speed. Keep it up!
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 18 Sep 2019,None,I've been M1 loyal customer for more than 15 yrs. Happy with it so far. No plans to change telcos anytime soon
Level 9. God of Wisdom,Posted on 28 Aug 2019,None,Didn't even have any chance to talk to customer service officers before. I saved them tons of customer service officer fees... they shld give me a voucher. lol
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 21 Aug 2019,None,"I have been with M1 for over 20 years and still they are the best for me, always giving the best under the Sun, I am extremely pleased and happy to be their customer"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 21 Aug 2019,None,"Absolutely best customer service as compared to 2 previous telcos I've tried. Been with them for more than 10yrs since. On top of that, best corporate plan!"
Level 7. Grand Master,Posted on 21 Aug 2019,None,- tried the Facebook messenger chat and it was quite a good customer experience  Overall I am a happy customer ! 
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 19 Aug 2019,None,"Overall, it is good but there is one very important downside to this. Sometimes, especially around the town area, reception is very bad and will lose the signal. This only happens for people using M1 as their mobile provider. This also only happens for M1 as another person standing beside me using Singtel or Starhub can have full signal while I have zero."
Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 15 Aug 2019,None,I am a user of the M1 Sim only plan paying $25 a month. This plan is the most value for money and service is not too bad as well although coverage is slightly worse than Singtel.
Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"Been using M1 for more than a decade before the raise of MVNO. Customer Serivce is responsive and coverage is good. Price is considered on the higher side due to price slashing of the entire sector. Wont recontract anymore, switching to MVNO. "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,Great discounts and user friendly mobile app. Ease of adding on roaming or other services as and when required.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,- Customer Service is relatively efficient
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,"M1 Broadband also has the best deal at $39.90 with free Google Home Mini. The mobile salesperson even came to my void deck to complete the deal, no queuing required!"
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 29 Jul 2019,None,"I received the worst customer service on record from this firm. After using them extensively for 4 years, they sent me a bill of over 1000 SGD due to data roaming charges even though I had network lock enabled. Turns out that if you are in a country without partner network, the network lock won't prevent you from connecting to networks M1 doesn't partner with. What's more, the information on the M1 app is misleading and unclear. Also, the SMS that is meant to prevent you from incurring data charges of more than 100 dollars is also nonsense - I disabled data roaming immediately and my charge is 10 times more! To top it all, they don't want to waive those charges and they expect me to pay for their mistakes. I am switching to another provider. "
Level 5. Genius,Posted on 01 Jul 2019,None,"Not the best service but cheapest. Been using it for 4 years. For contract renewal, usually waiver for early contract given after 1years, which mean every year you can change new phone if you want. "
Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 01 Jul 2019,None,"Had been using M1 for quite a number of years. No complaints so far in terms of coverage and service, except maybe in some MRTs. But with the new contract-less plans, it is a good value for money. Would recommend!"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Jun 2019,None,"I'm using M1 now for a bit more than 3 months and I had a lot of problems with the provider. First of all the provided information system, when the data is almost gone no notifications are given. Also my money was fully gone of my account, went to the shop, then I needed to call a number, no service or whatsoever at the store. During my call I got information and could try it again, but they didn't correctly explain me how it worked, so I lost again my money. After 3 phone calls and one visit to the shop, I discovered my fault, but if someone told me earlier I would not lose my money twice. furthermore you can't keep the data not used on the previous month and today I had the problem that my data was expired, no problem I switched of my data, but all the money I still had on my account and was not used for anything was gone. To summarize bad services from the personnel and also no information about the status of the phone.  "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Jun 2019,None,"M1 service used to be excellent. Now, the phone line takes very long to get through. My app does not allow you to redeem points. The helpline, after telling them the problem, insist that there is a problem with my phone. (This is the second phone I am using and the app still does not work). "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 30 May 2018,None,"I have been using StarHub for many years and am generally satisfied with the reliable service. As I am familiar with it’s roaming plans and data upsize options, will continue to use StarHub to save the hassle of switching to another telco."
Level 5. Genius,Updated on 01 May 2018,None,"Has been a loyal M1 user, love its customer service and no billing issue so far. Was with another telco which double charge when I transfer line to under my name (charge my friend and charge myself for the same month). "
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 24 Apr 2018,None,Been using M1 for the past 15 years and the customer service is wayyyy better than Singtel. My family is on the MSS plan (the old scheme which give us 30% for 4 member). 
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,Been using m1 since forever maybe 15 years now. Currently my whole family except my brother who stuck to singtel is using it. Excellent customer service on the phone.. Don't have too many attitude problems and they are very patient.. Even when you see them in person at the shop ( i patronise the clementi branch ) was a sucker for the free m1 calls to 3 m1 numbers and it saved me a lot of money. On top of that still benefit from multi lines and corporate discounts. I can't rmb which discount i am on right now. Only con is that they downgraded my 12gb to x gb a long time ago without me knowing raaarrrrr. Connection when compared to star hub side by side is much better. Have considered switching before but can't find any plans that fits my needs and at this cost. Hope they give us more loyalty rewards hehehe. Also their old mysim plan gives others a run for their money. Not gonna recontract. They also have an app that does the basics for tracking purpose. 
Level 9. God of Wisdom,Updated on 28 Mar 2018,None,"Their customer service is one of the best around and very friendly staff. Recently went to recontract and the staff informed me of the NTUC member promo which gives 10% off mobile bill, extra 1gb, roaming and free caller ID!! "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 27 Jan 2021,None,"[Customer Service] The issue at stake is the fact that while Starhub can repackage their channels (which is their prerogative) it can not do so at the expense of their current customers, which is what Starhub is doing, and getting away with. So the hard choices you refer to are hard only for the customers (hundreds of customers, who are all fuming right now), not for Starhub. If you were really concerned about your customers, you would retain the choices of the current customers (or offer something equivalent), while offering whatever you want to offer to entice new customers. Anything else is simply lip service to customer service."

Service is very slow and poor. Telesales and production don’t even know why and what cause NO DATA!  The follow up is only keep asking n verified what your handphone No. and IC no. After that all NO response. Very disappointed. 3 day without data , very angry n sad been with them for  more than 10yrs. I will change to other operators."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Nov 2020,None,[Customer Service] is a shame. They are able to de-bundle your services to charge you more afterward. I would not recommend. No serious after sale service.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Nov 2020,Purchased,[Customer Service] I have signed plans with the big 3 telcos and Starhub’s CS is the worst among the 3. Each call to their hotline will need waiting time of more than 20mins. CSO say that they will call back but I never hear from them at all.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 15 Oct 2020,Purchased,"They have an alright customer service and generally are OK with waiving fees if you actually bother to ask nicely/rudely. Additionally, the app is pretty easy to use to check for data usage and bills. Stuck with them all these while but I would assume their pricing is not as good as the rest of their competitors."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 12 Oct 2020,Purchased,"1) Their mobile app is user-friendly, it is easy for me to search my plan detail and etc. It is also easy to see how much call times, sms or data left for the month."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 06 Oct 2020,None,Worst customer service. Plans are no better than other providers. Got rid of them and switched to M1 who have a much better network and customer service.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 21 Sep 2020,Purchased,"Worst phone company ever! Your bill is so confusing and makes no sense and when you call, you'll notice the most nonsensical inefficient nature of how the menu options are prioritized: dial 1 for the new Samsung Galaxy phone (like this is a common thing people dial Starhub for????), dial 2 for blah blah and after listening to a whole list of choices you finally hear the menu option you are looking for. Starhub needs to employ people with common sense. Respect and save your customer's time. They also wrongfully billed me for an Amazon Prime membership which could not be cancelled. Borderline fraudulent company. Try M1 instead."

Bad experience of using StarHub, their Mobile plan is worth for getting more data but internet relatively unstable. If u stay near Malaysia border, I strongly object you to use StarHub, phone unable to receive call, roaming charges Incurred if u pick up those call and they don’t waive it, in the end they won’t solve the issue and ask u to pay. So I decided to deactivate my international roaming service and waiting to change my next mobile plan with SingTel"
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 10 Aug 2020,None,"The network is relatively stable. However, the app can be a bit buggy at times. Customer service takes some time to get back through email."
Level 5. Genius,Updated on 07 Aug 2020,None,One of the better experience will be the mobile application where I can see my current data usage and my past usages. Network and personal data wise are mostly ok for most days and will only be slower once in awhile.
Level 6. Master,Updated on 02 Aug 2020,Purchased,"Starhub was one of my worst experiences with a telco service - I've used M1, Singtel and finally, Circles. I only onboarded with Starhub to get a phone at the best price, which I soon regretted due to the poor customer service and telco service. When I went overseas, they charged roaming fees despite me turning off roaming - I called to cancel the fees and explain the error, and the customer service was dismissive about it and took more than a few months to do a refund. The data service is laggy as well as compared to Circles, which I use now. It's also at an average/higher price point, which doesn't justify it's poor service and delay. All in all, I'd avoid Starhub services in the future due to the presence of better local alternatives."

Level 5. Genius,Updated on 27 Jan 2020,Purchased,[Customer Service] Get notifications to claim rewards on app for being loyal to StarHub. Was offered free 50GB more monthly. Basically I feel carefree - like using unlimited. Filling up form online gets quick response via email.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 20 Jan 2020,None,"[Customer Service] This is totally non-existent. From the hotline to the walk-in counter support, their customer service is clueless and kept referring me around to get simple things resolved.  [Billing] Personally, WATCH your bill if you are using them. If you challenge them on dubious billing, they cant give you a good answer and will beat around the bush to get you off the topic. I have IDD built in my plan and they constantly charges small amounts into my monthly bills and when challenged, some of it got waived, was a sneaky more and this was one of my main push to switch providers.  in summary, if $$, customer service and coverage is not important for your phone plan, you can consider them, otherwise, skip and move on.

Level 2. Rookie,Posted on 06 Nov 2019,None,Horrible service. Did not honour the promise. Make customer wait for their call but in the end customer have to call in to ask again and again. Due to their negligence we have to use our mobile internet and burst our monthly bill while waiting for their arrangement on fibre. Suggest to use another provider which is cheaper and reliable.
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 02 Oct 2019,None,I really love starhub. But personally I felt starhub is losing out on its market capitalization. Would really hope starhub bucks up and adapts to the current market!

Level 6. Master,Updated on 22 Aug 2019,None,"Pros: unlimited weekend data is fantastic and $20 a month with no contract is decent; coverage is comparable to Singtel and M1 imo (was a user under them 1 and 2 years ago respectively); customer service on Facebook is good and replies quickly to resolve issues; data roaming prices are decent for certain countries; cheapest out of all the telcos for line suspension (5.35 per month) Overall, for the price, I am content but the whole customer service experience can be improved upon."
Level 3. Wonderkid,Posted on 21 Aug 2019,None,"Using prepaid card and i would say the Price is competitive , reasonable , and signal is strong. Customer service is way better than other telco."
Level 4. Prodigy,Updated on 21 Aug 2019,None,"I'm on StarHub's XS mobile plan ($36/mth). The connection and speed both Indoors and outdoors are good. Connection issues are very rare.

I'll switch to a cheaper plan that offers a reasonable service after my current plan expires."

Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 17 Aug 2019,None,"Switched from M1. Been 3 months and so far so good. The experience signing up was good, with helpful customer service people there. I like the interface of the app, and it tells me how much data im using. Free weekend data so I have plenty of data to use (they had some sort of promotion so I have 20GB of free data monthly as well). Just a little gripe though. I called starhub helpline (for my internet issue) previously, and it counted all that time (even tho i dialed 1800) as talktime used up. I nearly busted my 100mins due to it. So whoever's intending to use Starhub and don't have a home phone like me, do be careful when calling helplines, even Starhub's. "
Level 4. Prodigy,Posted on 14 Aug 2019,None,I have been leveraging my first 2 companies' CIS (Corporate Individual Scheme). I have always found StarHub CIS come up cheaper than SingTel CIS. Loyal customer of 7+ years :)
Level 3. Wonderkid,Updated on 14 Aug 2019,None,"I am using the Postpaid plan. I like the improved Starhub App that allows a lot of monitoring and even customisation to the plans as and when needed. BUT, I realised when they upgrade their plans, the previous customers suffer. My mum is still on an old plan that gives the least but charges more than my current plan. When asked, they said, oh! she is under contract so need to first finish before switching to the new plan. C'mon! "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 14 Aug 2019,None,"the WORST customer experience I've had in ANY company of ANY kind, EVER.

I wont do this mistake again. For sure. Oh and the broadband from Myrepublic much better."

It has been almost 5 months since I ended my contract with Starhub but until now i have not heard from them.  WORSE and TERRIBLE customer service. PLEASE DO NOT USE STARHUB NETWORK!!!. Thanks
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Jun 2019,None,Starhub has the lousiest customer service. They messed up our connections in the move to fiber and to date we cannot have a workable solution despite filing many complains. We will have to find other vendors.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Apr 2019,None,"StarHub's customer service has certainly improved over the years. While I used to have to wait on the phone for ~1h to speak to a human being, nowadays I can just send in an enquiry (via email/webform) and I will receive an email/call the next day to follow up on my case. I once even received a call on a Saturday. Really feel that they have taken steps to improve customer service and satisfaction, so kudos to them. Overall, StarHub's mobile coverage is pretty good and fast. Sometimes it lags a bit, but for the most part it works fine. I wish they would include free SMS in their plans (though I do recognise it's not a popular service anymore) and give bill rebates for a longer time, considering the equivalent plans in other telcos cost around $20 only. Still, it's not a dealbreaker given the great service I've had in recent times."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Apr 2019,None,"I am using Starhub for over 10 years. I got a second sim for $15 per month starting last year. Suddenly my $15 service plus changed to $100.9346 per month in Nov last year.  I complained to their CS and their feedback was I terminated the $15 service plus myself from their iphone app and it would automatically switch to $100 plan.  I didn't know this option, never did it and I also cannot find this option in the app. Even there is an option to terminate the second sim, why activate a $100 plan for me?  It is totally a scam. No more ""Scamhub"" for the rest of my life."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 24 Feb 2019,None,Horrible customer care service. Pathetic sales. You will hit your head to the wall if you plan to buy a plan with them. more over they seems like scammer. Not at all recommended.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 13 Dec 2018,None,Horrible customers service. Send an sms to confirm the date for the technician to come and was cancelled without informing me. I have to rush back from work just for this appointment.  Called up to hotline and waited for more than 45 minutes!!!

Additionally, they charged me around $100 for the switch even though my plan has already ended."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Oct 2018,None,"Used to give royalty rewards for contract renewal, now they do not appreciate royal customer anymore."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Mar 2018,None,I had been a StarHub subscriber since 2003 and the true value for me had been the savings from having the full suite of services available.  I had been a HubClub member since it started and most of the time a Platinum Club member.  The savings I get from these are pretty significant in the range of $20-30 each month.  Besides that HubClub allows me to recontract annually on one of my plans which allowed me to buy a new iPhone every time it is launched and make money selling the old one (the 2nd price is more than the recontract price I have to pay).  This is even more savings for me.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated 3w ago,Purchased,"[Customer Service]  I've found it fast and responsive, possibly even better than speaking with a person over the phone as you don't have to hang around and wait for your call to be connected. I've also been pleasantly surprised by how they've gone the extra mile. I lost my phone and needed a replacement SIM card. The request was processed quickly and they said they would dispatch the replacement by normal mail. This is reasonable and what I expected. I got a call an hour later asking if I'd be at home later in the day as someone would drop the SIM card off. I said I wouldn't but they could just leave it under the door. The replacement was indeed delivered later that day and it was clear one of their staff hand-delivered it (there was no courier note and it was in a hand-labelled envelope). Sort of reminds me of what a lean start-up trying their best to keep their customers happy would do. Who knows, maybe it was the CEO who hand-delivered the package. It felt strangely authentic and personal. So, full marks for this! The line was ported over in the middle of the night so I didn't suffer any actual inconvenience. Porting the number over is as convenient/inconvenient compared to other service providers. I don't think there can be a 100% seamless experience regardless of who you switch to. It's just how it is.  The only issue I had was when I eagerly tried my ViviFi SIM card the moment M1 cut my service. I don't think the port-over process had been completed yet so my iPhone registered the new temporary ViviFi number, messing up my FaceTime and iMessage. Couldn't remove the new number. I spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this (ViviFi couldn't help me unfortunately) but eventually I found out that I just had to wait for Apple to update its servers and I could re-register my ported over number. Long story short it wasn't ViviFi's fault and I think a potential issue when one changes providers. Best to just not do anything till after ViviFi's specified port-over period."
Level 6. Master,Updated on 02 Feb 2021,Purchased,"They used singtel network, so I think the reception and signal is the best out there already. Just don't expect any customer service. The website is quite bare minimum, and there is no app to track live usage, so that means you have to log in to the website to check. For me, I had some problems with the delivery of the sim cards, so the delivery guy had to come again, at my own expense of course. One of the cheapest plan for their who don't need a lot of data, so can't complain much."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 11 Jan 2021,Purchased,"[Customer Service] I lost my SIM card and sent them an email on Sunday.  Surprisingly, I got their reply within one hour.   They manage to send me a new sim card in 2 hours after communication.   Great!!  Never expect it can be so efficient.   "
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 10 Jan 2021,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Used it for 2 months and didn’t like the network. wrote in in early Nov to terminate the SIM as instructed In the website. found the charges in Dec credit card bill. Wrote in again and the service feedback with an email, which received as spam, asking if I want to terminate or port out. But can’t explain why people need to write to them to apply for “port out”, while I already instructed then to terminate. They just want your money. You won’t be able to know if your line is terminate until you see the card bill. Sorry you will be charged for another month because it will only terminate the service at the end of the month. My request in early Nov didn’t end the service, and I will be charged for Jan full month. How about Feb? I am not sure. When they decide not to feedback your email. You don’t know what they are up to."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 23 Dec 2020,Purchased,"Customer service: I also disagree with some users about the efficiency of their customer service.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 09 Dec 2020,Purchased,"Have been using the service for several months.

This the first with ✌️ on SG oldest reliable network source but younger vibrant newbie operator with promising connections. Self-collection was easy and the staff friendly helpful, saved $12 on delivery charge. Impression wise a good start to kick off with my new service provider. Signal no problem as as far I recall. Value bundle a preferable choice. Though no app not an issue as accessible thru website shortcut link. Satisfied customer highly recommend 👍"
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 15 Sep 2020,None,"Poor customer service, slow response, no live chat if not customer. Unable to be flexible in my case 2 numbers to port but they were rigid in trying to make me pay 2 x $12 for SIM card delivery of the same address and same time application. No flexibility to deal this offline. Unfortunately this deters me from signing up. Self collection locations are limited as well."

So far I am satisfied with Vivifi. Efficient.  Thank you.  I hope I can continue with Vivifi service with confidence.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] Excellent customer service they reply to you within minutes of sending an inquiry. Even at night, they are here to address your concerns. Truly a customer service focused Telco.  They are a new player in the market but definitely excels in customer service and great value for their plan too."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"I have been using the Vivifi Lite Plan since Apr20 and for this price I must say the services and connectivity have exceeded my expectations. I not only have great connection, but I'm also paying lesser each month compared to other telco. There was a time when I had to reach out to the customer service for an enquiry and my query was answered promptly within a day. Kudos to the great customer service. All in all, I would definitely recommend subscribing to Vivifi."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"To start, there is no port-in or registration fee if you choose to pick up the SIM card in person, where pick up points are conveniently located at various MRT stations.  VIVIFI Lite is especially suited for consumers who already have frequent access to WiFi and thus do not need much mobile data, with 3GB offered. They are also for those who would appreciate being able to make reliable calls across the island frequently, since it includes a call time of 500 minutes. SMSs are kept to a low of 20, which is fine since the average person does not even use SMS anymore."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,Generally the speed of service is good and price is very reasonable. Especially for those who are light user. I simply can't find another Telco who can pits them in all services and prices.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"Network is impeccable since it is using Singtel's infrastructure. So far no experience of dead spots. I have the habit to put my phone to airplane mode at night. But I noticed that upon turning back on the phone, the connectivity to 4G+ is quite instant without noticeable lag. Despite Vivifi being a MVNO, the customer service is considered quite good. Prompt response through the WhatsApp customer chat. Billing cycle is at every first day of the month. So you don't have to headache when is your next billing cycle. Best part is, if you finish using either your entitled air time, data, or SMS of the month, you got to top up value to the wallet before able to reload the service that you require. As I use this line mainly for work purpose, it is good that I do not exceed either my call time or data and get charged automatically. I have the freedom of choice on whether I want to top up and pay or not. Can't comment on the porting because I took a new number. Mobile App wise, I don't see any so far. But the web account has been clean and friendly to use. Easy to navigate around and easy to understand. Overall, extremely happy with the service provided. I would highly recommend Vivifi if the plans that they provide serves your usage needs."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"Hello friends, writing this review to share my awesome experience with Vivifi. I was not at all happy with my last operator and their customer service was so pathetic and giving false information over and over. Finally I decided to move out of that operator. I was browsing through the best operators currently in Singapore and I got a lots of them! It was really hard to choose between them, however, as per my usage and need I selected Vivifi and was not very sure whether my expectation will fulfill. To my great surprise the purchase process just took couple of minutes and as promised they delivered the new SIM in just 2 days! More to my surprise this request was actually for a port in number and I was scary what will happen to my old number if port in fails, but the process was like driving your car in an empty highway! The day the new SIM was delivered that night only the port in happened without any interruption as it took place between 12 am and 4 am. Next day morning when I switched on my phone the port in success message was delivered and it was so sweet :-) Till now there is no problem in tracking my usage, no issue in internet speed, call quality is very good. Hope this service provider get greater mileage and continuously improve their service to retain new customer base."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 08 Sep 2020,Purchased,"Good to share with users with low usage monthly as it is value for money. No problems with connection or customer service. Customer service responded to my queries rather efficiently. Initially, I had problems porting in. The first time I ported in, one existing line got ported out. VIVIFI did some troubleshooting and told me it will be ported in the next day, and the same line got ported out instead of my line being port in. Even though porting took a while with some inconvenience, customer service was quick in replying. However, tracking is inconvenient as it is only available to the main account holder which is accessibl"

The phone line keep dropping when i was having conversation with my customer and Friends. It was very ignoring and the customer support terms keep asking repeating question which already provided and until now 7th Sep 2020 (2 weeks) is still not slove.
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 29 Aug 2020,Purchased,"Great family plan to choose from especially since my grandparents use more call time than data and vice versa. Network connection is good even on underground mrt but sometimes (rarely), my connection disappears for 3-5 minutes. Easy porting and customer service was good. However, it will be even better with an app. Also, waiting for a referral plan programme. Hope that it will be ready soon!"

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 27 Aug 2020,Purchased,"I've been switching around with a multitude of MVNOs, struggling to find the perfect operator. The majority of MVNOs either have lousy network reliability and coverage, zeroed their customer service, or both. Fortunately, these are the critical areas that VIVIFI excels in, and being affordable too! - VIVIFI has provided me with exceptional customer service, even replying to my queries almost immediately at 11pm! - Can only check your data and manage your services through their web-based dashboard. No app available on Android and iOS."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 26 Aug 2020,Purchased,I can get very network coverage from ViviFi . There was only 1 service disruption around early Jan 2020  but ViviFi gave us rebate to our monthly bill to compensate the inconvenience caused.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 21 Aug 2020,Purchased,"I have been using the VIVIFI service for 3 months, and I would recommend it go for because of its signal quality and coverage. Additionally, I have noticed there were no delays while receiving OTPs for online purchases or so. Its the best service provider with qualities at a cheaper price. They don't have the mobile app, but they have a home page and you can see your data usages and other details. Depending on your usages, you can choose the plans and prices were very competitive or cheaper when compared to others like Singtel or StarHub.  Overall, I am very happy with the service and this company should run longer in Singapore."
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 21 Aug 2020,Purchased,2) it is good that they have introduced viviplus plan. why do n't you let the customers to share this plan also?
Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 21 Aug 2020,Purchased,"I have been with Singapore's largest telco for 10 years. At first I was hesitant about switching over to VMNO due to bad reviews on social medias that no human CS available to attend to their issues. I'd hence spent some time researching on all available VMNOs in SG and found Vivifi. Despite its new startup position in the market, I can see that Vivifi's customers are happy with their service. Hence I decided to give Vivifi a try. I'm happy with their service now and no network interruption so far. The only issue I experienced with Vivifi was my billing (2-months promo) but CS managed to resolved the first month promo (hopefully my 2nd-month promo applies smoothly too)."

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 20 Aug 2020,Purchased,"Plus: Port over from M to Vivifi Share (5 lines) for 5 moths and no issue with network.

Level 2. Rookie,Updated on 20 Aug 2020,Purchased,"[Customer Service] The drawback of Vivifi is the lack of an always-available customer service.
